<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>
</div>
<p>Two great faults have been found with my first
edition. The first was, that I had offended many
people by personal allusions. To this, I reply, that
offence was very far from my mind; and to those
offended (if any there be), I say, consider the expressions
unsaid. For the rest, they are omitted in
this edition. The second alleged defect is, that, while
I call my book, to a certain extent, sporting, so little
allusion is made to sport. I grant there is some
reason in this, and accordingly I have added matter
which I think will be useful to future sporting tourists.
I would, however, not advise the man who seeks
sport alone and solely to go to Algeria, as I am sure
he will be disappointed, as I most decidedly was.
With regard to the illustrations, I have taken the
greatest pains that they may faithfully represent, not
only the particular localities alluded to, but also
give a fair idea of the country and climate of these
latitudes.</p>

<h3>THE VOYAGE OUT.</h3>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Paris in 1860.&ndash;&ndash;Notre Dame.&ndash;&ndash;Our Hotel.&ndash;&ndash;Nero and the Groom.&ndash;&ndash;The
Steamer for Algeria.&ndash;&ndash;Gallic Peculiarities.&ndash;&ndash;Life on Board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>In medias res.</i> I will not stop to describe my journey
to Paris, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Folkestone, nor to chronicle the glasses
of pale ale&ndash;&ndash;valedictory libations to <i>perfide</i> Albion,
quaffed at the Pavilion&ndash;&ndash;nor to portray the sea-sickness
of &ldquo;mossoo,&rdquo; nor the withering indignation of
the British female when her wardrobe was searched.
Briefly, kind reader, be pleased to understand that
we arrived in safety&ndash;&ndash;guns, rifles, &ldquo;and all&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;at the
H&ocirc;tel du Louvre, in Paris, at about eleven o&rsquo;clock on
a certain day in February, 1860.</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday, and I went to hear
vespers at Notre Dame. How I love the old gothic
cathedrals, that seem to remove one at once from
this work-day world&ndash;&ndash;the fanes wherein the very air
seems redolent of devotion, and peopled with phantoms
of the past! &rsquo;Spite of all disparagement, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
is something grand and solemn about them. After
service, I ascended one of the towers to the gallery
immortalised by Victor Hugo&rsquo;s wonderful romance.
The day was declining, and sunset had already commenced.
The galleries were crowded with students
and respectable operatives and <i>bourgeois</i>, with their
wives and children. Every face was bathed in the
purple light of the departing sun, and many eyes
lifted up in silent meditation.</p>
<p>I was aroused from the reverie into which the contemplation
of this glorious sight had thrown me, by
hearing a female voice exclaim, &ldquo;How beautiful is
Nature&ndash;&ndash;how magnificent!&rdquo; I turned, and saw two
ladies, evidently mother and daughter, of sufficiently
pleasing appearance. It was from the elder that the
exclamation had come, which brought me back from
my dream to this nether world. Conquering the
shyness which appears to be the Englishman&rsquo;s birthright,
I made some remark on the beauties of sunset.
Like the earth, we revolved round the sun; but, unlike
that planet, we quickly diverged into other orbits.
I dimly remember that we talked of Angola cats,
Dresden china, Turkish chibouques, maccaroni, and
Lord Byron, with whose poems this lady seemed
sufficiently familiar. I improved the occasion, as the
right thing to do, when talking with ladies about
Byron, to find fault with his impiety, his blasphemous
scepticism, his cutting sarcasm, and the <a name='TC_1'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'unhapy'">unhappy</ins> frivolity
which defaces the works of the man, who, with all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
his faults, was undoubtedly the greatest poet the nineteenth
century has yet produced.</p>
<p>A pleasant walk along the quays brought me back
to my hotel, in the courtyard of which establishment
I found an admiring circle of idlers surrounding my
English groom, who had just arrived with my dog
Nero; or rather Nero, who seemed by far the most
popular character of the two, had just arrived
with him; and both appeared to know about as
much French one as the other, and to make themselves
equally understood or misunderstood. That
evening, my friend and travelling companion,
B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; and I dined at Dotesio&rsquo;s, in the Rue
Castiglione, where we had an excellent dinner,
washed down by more excellent wine. The next
day found us at Marseilles, at the H&ocirc;tel D&rsquo;Orient,
concerning which hostelry I have merely to place on
record the fact, that B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; was mulcted in the sum
of five francs for the matutinal cold tub in which it
was his custom to indulge.</p>
<p>The steamer which was to convey us to Algeria
was well fitted up in every way. We were the only
Englishmen on board. The fore part of the deck
was crowded with Zouaves and French soldiers of
various denominations, with whom Nero soon made
himself perfectly at home, though the exclamation of
a Zouave on his first appearance seemed to forbode
but an indifferent reception for the four-footed intruder.
&ldquo;<i>Cr&eacute; nom d&rsquo;un chien</i>&rdquo; cried the shaven,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
fez-capped warrior, &ldquo;<i>mais je ne t&rsquo;aimerais pas pour
mon camarade du lit!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast was served in French fashion on board
at ten o&rsquo;clock, and dinner at five. With one or two
exceptions, the company consisted of French commercial
travellers, and they were split up into the
usual hostile factions of north against south. North,
of course, commenced the conversation with Paris,
<i>Paris</i>, and again <span class='smcap'>Par-rri</span>; the southerners every
now and then throwing in a doubt of the universal
superiority of the metropolis over the known world.
One disputant stood out for Marseilles, another broke
a lance for Bordeaux, and the war of words waxed so
fierce that I began to tremble for the consequences.
One young man in company had been some time at
Bordeaux, and had much to say thereon; but all his
remarks were on one subject&ndash;&ndash;the theatre. On its
beauty, its luxury, and its actresses, he held forth at
unwearied but wearisome length.</p>
<p>While this conversation was going on, the inner
man was by no means neglected. Stewed pullets, potatoes,
salad, and etceteras, disappeared with marvellous
celerity. The cheer was by no means bad, though
decidedly Proven&ccedil;al, as I remarked to my next neighbour,
a dark-looking Marsellais; which observation, by
the way, brought down upon me the anger of the
Gods, as impersonated by a large, fat, dirty Calaisien,
sitting opposite. He was a big man, this champion,
and, according to Cervantes, should, by consequence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
have been a good-natured one. Giving himself a
sounding blow on the chest for emphasis, he declared
the Calaisiens to be an infinitely more moral people
than the Marseillais&ndash;&ndash;and washed down his own dictum
with an enormous glass of <i>bi&egrave;re blanche</i>. I am rather
fond of going to sleep after dinner; so I secured my
nap on cheap terms, by feigning an interest in the
Picard virtues, and accordingly enjoyed a profound
rest, disturbed only at intervals by a monotonous and
expostulatory &ldquo;<i>allons donc!</i>&rdquo; thrown in by another
dissentient southerner. He was an enormously fat man,
the new disputant, and wore a mass of very greasy hair,
hanging down over his shoulders. His flannel shirt,
an exceedingly dingy specimen of British manufacture,
did duty for a waistcoat also; but he was <i>decor&eacute;</i>,
though it was very doubtful to what order the medal
on his breast may have belonged.</p>
<p>Our captain merits a word of description. He was
a short, red-faced individual, of such ineffable seediness,
as regarded costume, that I should never have suspected
his station but for the fact that he sported a
gold band &ldquo;<i>bien usit&eacute;</i>&rdquo; round his cap, and sat at the
head of the table. For the credit of French politeness
be it, however, added, he was a perfect gentleman
in his behaviour throughout the voyage. There was
also a young French naval officer, whom I afterwards
got to know much better in Algeria. He, too, like all
the Legitimists, was a most finished gentleman, and
spoke English well&ndash;&ndash;a common accomplishment among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
the officers of the French navy. Though quite a
young fellow, he had been in the Russian and Chinese
wars, and imparted some very amusing and instructive
intelligence on both these subjects.</p>
<p>As the noise and the intimacy at the table increased,
and the punch and cognac had already
&ldquo;chased&rdquo; the wine, I adjourned with B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; and the
French sailor to the after-deck, and, in company with
two young Dutch travellers, smoked our Havanas in
a climate that was already African in its heat, while
Majorca and Minorca faded away in the distance, and
the pale moon rose silently over the quiet sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF ALGIERS.</h3>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrival in Algeria.&ndash;&ndash;Murray&rsquo;s Guide-books, and their Amenities.&ndash;&ndash;Disembarkation
in the Port of Algiers.&ndash;&ndash;Our Fellow-travellers.&ndash;&ndash;Algiers
and its Inhabitants.&ndash;&ndash;The Dey&rsquo;s Palace.&ndash;&ndash;Cause of the
French Invasion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next morning, at eight o&rsquo;clock, came the waiter with
the intelligence&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;<i>Nous sommes dans la baie d&rsquo;Alger,
monsieur, &agrave; une heure de la ville.</i>&rdquo; My desire to see
Algiers was vehement indeed; but scarcely less strong
was the craving of the inner man for bread and coffee.
With the nectar of Arabia, however, the inspiration of
the Orient seemed to percolate my veins; but when a
fragrant glass of cognac crowned the meal, the aroma
of the East enveloped me, the delicious strains of
Bulbul rang in my ears, the Calaisien and the Marseillais,
sitting stolidly before me, became straightway
transformed into camels, the stewardess into a houri,
and the noses of the passengers were as masques in
my enraptured sight.</p>
<p>But the book at my side was not the Koran,
though it might have been, for the strange farrago it
contained.</p>
<p>It was a celebrated traveller&rsquo;s manual in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
English language, and in red binding. The king of
the Cannibal Islands has not in his library a more
absurd volume than this manual; for in its pages
pathetic bagmen give vent to their ludicrous ebullitions
concerning the Alhambra, or the Rhine, or any foreign
lion you please to name; and young boys just escaped
from school dish up their first impressions of the
Continent in a style as savoury as the flavour of a
Spanish olla podrida. And yet, ascend the Rhine, go
to Venice or to St. Petersburg, and ten to one for
the chance, that when you meet an Englishman he
will have that eternal manual clutched in his British
grasp.</p>
<p>Oh, my dear and well-beloved countrymen, what
creatures of fashion and precedent we all are, from
high to low! What one does, the rest must do; and
in the self-same manner. I verily believe, if the late
Albert Smith had left it on record that, in ascending
Mont Blanc, he planted his foot in a certain hole in
the snow, every one of his successors in that glorious
undertaking would have paid their guides an extra
dollar for indicating to them the identical cavity, that
they might go and do likewise. Thank goodness, Algeria
is as yet encumbered by no manual or &ldquo;Hand-book,&rdquo;
as our modern Germanised phraseology elects to call
the egregious productions; so shall we travellers be at
liberty to follow our own noses, to go exactly where
we like, and to do what we please, even to dressing
like Arabs, should the whim seize us. Moreover, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
may do in Rome as Rome does, and enjoy a French
breakfast washed down with good wine in lieu of bad
tea, without having ourselves or our proceedings
stigmatised as &ldquo;shocking,&rdquo; as would undoubtedly be
our lot at Paris, or Brussels, or Berlin.</p>
<p>Behold us, then, in happy hour, ready to disembark
in Algiers, with the children of the desert thronging
on board to act as porters. Their appearance pleases
me much, as they come forward, with their tall,
striking figures, dark eyes, and distinguished mien.
&ldquo;Perfect gentlemen, these,&rdquo; said I to myself; but beneath
the outside crust little remains that can be called
gratifying. These men are like the apple of Sodom;
at least, so I thought on landing, after a long squabble
with them respecting the passage money, carried on
in bad Italian and French. A nearer acquaintance
with them may, perhaps, modify my views on this
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it has been a pleasant time on board the
packet,&rdquo; is my parting reflection as I step ashore; nor
shall I lightly forget the captain, so different in his
politeness and urbanity from the sea-bear with whom
I sailed in the North Sea; nor the honest Hamburgher,
who appeared to have an equally beloved wife in
every land and in every place we came to; nor
the would-be dandy, who lit cigars innumerable,
and invariably flung them overboard after the first
puff; nor the priests, who seemed to possess the gift of
invisibility, so rarely did they show themselves; nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
the hundred thousand events and personages that flash
upon our path for a moment on our journey through
life, and then linger in the memory only as the dim
phantoms of a dream that has passed away.</p>
<p>Algiers, seen from the sea, presents the appearance
of a vast triangular cone, situated on the slope of
a mountain. Like all the inhabitants of Northern
Africa, the Algerians were at an early period Christians,
and it was only after several battles that the
Mahometan religion was finally established all over the
coast of Barbary. Before the French occupation, the
Algerian ladies, like the females in all Mussulmen
countries, were kept in the strictest seclusion. The
wife of a rich Moor never left her home except to go
to the baths, and even that expedition was undertaken
only at night. When it became absolutely necessary
that ladies should go abroad in daylight, their faces
were covered, and the whole figure so concealed by a
redundancy of wrappings, that a stranger would be
puzzled to find out what the moving bundles were.
The luxury of the bath is greatly used by them. There
are public as well as private baths. They consist of
three apartments. The first is a large hall, for dressing
and undressing; in the second, the visitors perspire;
and the third is for bathing proper, or otherwise, as
tastes and opinions somewhat differ. After the bath,
those of the male sex repair to the first room for
lemonade or coffee, or for a pipe. The modern
Mahometan ladies of Algiers have almost abandoned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
this seclusion. They are seen gadding about everywhere,
and are reported as being by no means particular
or difficult in their conquests. French ideas
and morals have percolated them considerably.
Excessive obesity is regarded among Mahometans
as the perfection of beauty; so that, instead of using
powders and other nostrums to reduce themselves,
like some of my friends at home, they devour seeds
and <i>couscous</i>, the national dish, especially employed
for fattening people. Some young ladies are crammed
to such a degree that they die under the operation.</p>
<p>On a fine, hot day in February, 1860, I mounted
the conical hill on which Algiers is built. The weather
was magnificent. The sun of Africa already made his
approach felt, and the mountains in the far horizon
stood out like <i>bas-reliefs</i> against the azure sky. Here
stood the palace of the Dey before the French occupation.
The building is now called the <i>casbah</i>, and
used as a large barrack; outside are the Moorish
houses, and the chief part of the Moorish population.</p>
<p>The cause of quarrel between France and Algeria,
which resulted in the conquest of the country by the
Gallic legions was as follows:&ndash;&ndash;The Dey, a pasha of
the old Turkish school, was, it appears, a potentate of
extravagant disposition, and owed the French Government
a considerable sum of money. The creditors,
being in a hurry for their cash, dunned the Dey incessantly,
through the agency of their consul. Unaccustomed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
to the eagerness of French importunity,
the Dey, on one unlucky occasion, made a gesture of
impatience with his fan, as a man might do with his
riding-whip, if his tailor became too pressing for the
settlement of his account. It proved an expensive
gesture, however; for within a few weeks it brought
10,000 French soldiers to the shores of the Dey, and
cost him his entire realm. The bulk of the Mauresque
and Turkish population quitted Algeria with their
families on the arrival of the French. Those who
remain are the poorer classes, and now live, if report
speaks true, in an immoral state. These events took
place in the reign of that peaceful monarch, Louis
Philippe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>LIFE IN ALGIERS.</h3>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Algerian Society.&ndash;&ndash;A <i>Soir&eacute;e</i> at General Martinprez&rsquo;s.&ndash;&ndash;The Sirocco.&ndash;&ndash;My
Maltese Companion.&ndash;&ndash;The Theatre.&ndash;&ndash;General Youssouf and
Career.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have described Algiers as being built on the side of
a mountain. The city possesses a commodious and
safe harbour, where flutter the colours of every nation,
from the red flag of the Swede to the Spaniard&rsquo;s
yellow ensign. Economy of space being a primary
consideration in the laying out of the city, the houses
have been built very high, and the streets made very
narrow, so that there is no room for carriages. The
Consul has a very fine Mauresque house in the old
Turkish quarter, where he invited me to dinner and
a <i>soir&eacute;e</i> the day after my arrival; and the next day I
was invited to the reception of the Governor, General
Martinprez.</p>
<p>The General received me and my companions
most graciously, and, after keeping me in conversation
for about five minutes, introduced me to his lady, a
very pleasing person. My friend A&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; and I were
then introduced to two or three other fashionable
ladies of Algiers; and, engrossed in conversation with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
these; we strangers were unconscious of a general
movement of the gentlemen towards the farther end
of the room, as a preliminary to the amateur concert.
I was quite ignorant of this Algerian regulation, by
which the gentlemen and ladies are separated as
effectually as in a Lutheran church (a fashion,
by-the-bye, we appear to be adopting). Accordingly,
on looking up, I observed, to my infinite
chagrin, that I was the &ldquo;observed of all observers,&rdquo;
and probably was set down as a <i>b&ecirc;te Anglais</i>,
who knew no better. The extensive crinoline
of the ladies effectually prevented a retreat in any
direction, and I was unpleasantly conscious of the
suppressed titter the fair ones tried to conceal behind
their fans. I endeavoured to summon up all the
resources of my London phlegm, to support me in
this ridiculous position; but, unfortunately, I possess
very little of that desirable quality. The fair one with
whom I was conversing evidently felt for the unpleasantness
of my situation, and very good-naturedly
kept me talking till the end of the first piece, when I
succeeded in making my escape.</p>
<p>How I inwardly abused the opera they were performing!
It was called &ldquo;<i>Le Diable</i>;&rdquo; and to me it
appeared as though the fiend in question had no tail&ndash;&ndash;or
rather, <i>no end</i>&ndash;&ndash;to that appendage, so long did the
time seem. Far be it from me to despise the arts;
I admire them in every shape, except in the compound
form of speech: <i>exempli grati&acirc;</i>, art-union, art-school,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
&amp;c. Why, in the name of common sense, can we not
talk English instead of German, and say school of arts,
union of arts, &amp;c.? I suppose we shall soon go a step
farther in imitation of our Germanic neighbours, and
call poetry by the appellation of poet-art. In the last
century, it seemed likely, as Johnson said, that we should
babble a dialect of France; in this, there is more
danger of our talking a Teutonic jargon. Let us stick
to the middle course&ndash;&ndash;for our language is essentially
half way between the German and the French, the
Teutonic and Romance tongues, and any attempt to
approximate too much to either extreme is simply
preposterous.</p>
<p>The next day we had the sirocco; and, to quote
the expression with which I once heard a popular
preacher commence a sermon, it was &ldquo;d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;d hot.&rdquo;
Start not, ladies of Belgravia, for the preacher in
question belonged not to the Anglican communion;
he held forth to mere vulgar audiences, at least, in a
remote locality. Thrice he repeated the expression
(which I will not), and then improved the occasion by
describing a place hotter than the crowded chapel in
which he was officiating, in the month of July. He
was evidently in his element. He was especially hot
against those modern spirits, who are not such faithful
believers in the burning flames of the lower regions,
and even begin to imagine they may have cooled
down, if they have not been quite extinguished.
&ldquo;And if&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he cried, in his ardour&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;if they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
on the point of being extinguished, I would with my
own breath rekindle the expiring flame!&rdquo; And his
voice, which sounded like a gale of wind, and his
face, red as a furnace, and his enormous fists fiercely
clenched, made it appear to the congregation, for
the moment, that this terrifying assertion was no
exaggeration. But to return to the sirocco.</p>
<p>In spite, or rather by reason of the heat, I went
for a stroll on the sea-shore with Nero, that we might
cool our wearied limbs in the azure wave of the
Mediterranean. We had been walking along the
shore for about a mile, when about twenty Arab dogs
rushed out most ferociously at Nero, and would, I
believe, have torn him to pieces, but for the large
hunting-whip with which I managed to keep them at
bay. There was with me a young Maltese boy, of
Irish parentage&ndash;&ndash;a most amusing character this urchin
was. He wanted me to take him into the interior as
my interpreter. &ldquo;Take me wid you, sir,&rdquo; was his
eloquent appeal; &ldquo;give me pound a month, sir; tell
Arabs you brother of Queen Victoria, sir; Arabs great
fools, sir; know no better, sir;&rdquo; but I was proof
against the voice of the charmer.</p>
<p>In returning, I met General Martinprez on horseback,
and saluted; of course, he returned my greeting
most graciously. But I was not a little amused, and
could hardly help laughing, when the young Hiberno-Maltese
tatterdemalion took off his dirty cap with a
flourish to the General, simultaneously with my salute,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
as if he had been my confidential friend, taking a
promenade with me.</p>
<p>That evening I went to the theatre. The piece
performed was &ldquo;<i>Les Femmes Terribles</i>&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and a terribly
Gallic flavour there was diffused over the whole
performance&ndash;&ndash;a kind of <i>haut go&ucirc;t</i>, for which we stolid
islanders have, happily, no relish.</p>
<p>General Youssouf was at the theatre this evening.
He is rather a fine-looking man, and not too stout.
His is a curious history. Originally a Christian slave
at Tunis, supposed to be the son of Italian parents,
he received the name of Youssouf (Joseph) from his
Mussulman masters at Tunis, where he was employed
in the Bey&rsquo;s palace. Of fine stature and handsome
appearance, the Christian slave soon attracted the
notice of the Bey&rsquo;s daughter, an honour to which he
was not insensible. The Bey was soon informed of
what was going on, and Joseph would have been caged,
if not racked, had not some kind friend apprised him
of the discovery, and of his own consequent danger.
A French man-of-war happened to be in the harbour at
La Goeletta, off Tunis, and young Youssouf, then about
twenty years of age, managed to effect his escape on
board. The Franks, of course, gladly received him
as an escaped Christian slave. The Bey sent to demand
him back; but the French commander gave
him politely to understand that he would see the Bey
experiencing the reverse of the joys of Paradise before
he would comply with such a request. The vessel set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
sail next day for Algiers, where the Gallic occupation
had just commenced. Young Youssouf&ndash;&ndash;who,
in addition to his knowledge of French and Italian,
could, of course, speak Arabic perfectly&ndash;&ndash;was here
landed, and became interpreter to a foot regiment.
Quick and clever, he was soon promoted, till he
attained an officer&rsquo;s rank. He is now a general in
the service. Entertaining&ndash;&ndash;perhaps naturally&ndash;&ndash;a
mortal hatred of the Arabs, he has generally been
selected to enforce those stern acts of reprisal against
the native population, which, though perhaps justified
by necessity, still bear the impress of great severity,
and are unpalatable to officers of French birth and
education. These measures he has always carried out
with strict fidelity and unrelenting harshness. He
was the centre of attraction this evening&ndash;&ndash;every battery
of eyes was turned upon him. He had fought
a duel with the editor of a newspaper, only that morning,
for abusing him or his wife, and had succeeded
in running the journalist through the shoulder.</p>
<p>The next few days I was engaged in making purchases,
chiefly of shot and necessary travelling articles,
for the interior. I was swimming my dog in the
water of the port, according to my daily custom, when
I stumbled on my servant, Angelo, whom I determined
to take with me into the interior. Besides
English, which he spoke very well, he could talk
Arabic quite fluently, and I found him very useful.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>&ldquo;UP THE COUNTRY.&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Departure from Algiers.&ndash;&ndash;Blidah.&ndash;&ndash;The Zouave Officers and their
Companions.&ndash;&ndash;Government Establishment of Horses.&ndash;&ndash;Joseph, the
Horse-dealer.&ndash;&ndash;To Arbah.&ndash;&ndash;The Caravanserai.&ndash;&ndash;Journey towards
Oued-el-Massin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Thursday, March 8th, after seeing A&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; start,
by diligence, with innumerable bags of cheviotine
(deer-shot), I and Angelo left Algiers with my newly-purchased
horses, and, passing through some very
pretty country, stopped at the first village, where
De Warn, a French officer, came up on horseback,
with his groom. He admired my horses very much,
and announced his destination to be the Maison
Carr&eacute;e, where he was going to shoot quails, a friend
of his having bagged forty there in one afternoon. It
came on to rain very hard as we passed through the
plain of the Medidja, and arrived at Bouffaseh, where
there is a column raised to the memory of twenty-three
men killed there during the war. We galloped
in to Blidah, the rain pouring down on us. At
dinner, I met A&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; in a <i>caf&eacute;</i>, with Count L&rsquo;Esparre
and three or four officers of the 1st Regiment of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Zouaves. They were a very pleasant set of fellows,
but did not appear to admire their remote quarters at
Blidah by any means. The heat, during the height
of summer, they informed me, was terrific, and the
private soldiers are not allowed to quit their quarters
between 10 <span class='smcaplc'>A.M.</span> and 5 <span class='smcaplc'>P.M.</span> during the four hottest
months of the year. We drank unlimited punch to
the &ldquo;Alliance,&rdquo; and, on returning to the hotel, after a
mutual exchange of good wishes, we found familiar
faces&ndash;&ndash;belonging to the Dutchmen who had travelled
with us from Marseilles to Algiers.</p>
<p>I went with Count L&rsquo;Esparre to see the Government
establishment of horses. There were some very fine
creatures of Arab breed; also some Persian horses
which had been presented by the Shah of Persia.
We then started on horseback for Medea, and on
my way passed the &ldquo;Grotto of Monkeys,&rdquo; but none of
the animals from which the grotto takes its name met
my inquiring gaze. The Rocher Pourri, which I also
passed on my way, had just acquired an additional but
a lugubrious celebrity, an Arab having killed a Frenchman
there the day before. We rode on to Medea
through a rattling snow-storm, and arrived properly
powdered at the H&ocirc;tel du Gastronome, where they
made us comfortable enough. Medea is built in a very
elevated situation, among the mountains, and must be
a very cold place.</p>
<p>On the next day, Saturday, it was still snowing
hard. A&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; had to provide himself with a horse, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
we were afterwards both engaged, with Angelo, my
Maltese servant, looking for mules to carry our baggage
to Teniet. At the hotel, there was a very celebrated
picture by Horace Vernet, for which one of
the Dutchmen offered a thousand francs, but the offer
was declined by Madame Gerard. In my opinion,
the picture was far from being a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Rising early on Sunday, I was immediately pounced
upon by a set of Arabs, who had engaged to take our
luggage, and to whom we had paid a deposit in advance.
They now refused to take our luggage at five francs
per day, the sum agreed upon, unless we retained their
valuable services all the time we remained at Teniet,
which, of course, we never contemplated doing. I
demanded back the deposit, but they would not give
it up. On going to the Bureau Arabe, we found it
closed, and the Commandant de Ville, to whom some
officers recommended us to apply, was gone to Blidah,
so there was nothing for it but to invoke the aid of
Joseph, a French horse-dealer, who engaged to take
our effects on two mules to Teniet at seven and a half
francs per mule per day, we paying the return journey.
After all, we could not manage to get off until one
o&rsquo;clock in the day. Joseph accompanied us as far as
Lodi, to indicate the route to the caravanserai of
Arbah, where we were to stay for the night. The
good horse-dealer insisted on our taking two or three
<i>petits verres</i> on the road. A terrible fellow he was
for &ldquo;nips,&rdquo; that Joseph.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>The road to Arbah lay across a very barren, desert,
mountainous country, with splendid views over the
whole Atlas range, as far as Mostaganem, now covered
with snow. We passed one or two Arab villages, and
had great difficulty in finding our way, on account of
the number of roads that branched off right and left.
On the journey we passed a very fine house belonging
to a rich Arab chief. We were sorely tempted to turn
in here, but refrained, and arriving at the caravanserai
at about seven o&rsquo;clock, found a party of French officers
just sitting down to dinner. They very politely invited
us to join them.</p>
<p>The caravanserai is a Government establishment.
In form it resembles a large farm yard, entirely walled
in and crenellated. It has stalls for horses, and good
accommodation for European travellers. A large fair
is held here every Wednesday, chiefly for the sale of
native horses. We had a long and interesting talk
with the officers, and then retired to bed, but not to
sleep, for our baggage had not arrived, and the bitter
cold kept us in a state of enforced watchfulness.</p>
<p>Before breakfast, next day, I walked out on a tour
of inspection through the neighbourhood. The caravanserai
is situated almost in the desert; and very
cold and barren are its surroundings. During breakfast,
we were rejoiced by the arrival of our baggage,
and at once started for Ouad-el-Massin. There is a
very grand sensation of solitude and silence in riding
through these vast plains. The weather was still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
tremendously cold and rainy. I managed to shoot
two partridges as we came along.</p>
<p>A chapter of accidents now began. My Maltese
servant had been mistaken concerning the capacity of
our mules; for they broke down, and we were obliged
to leave them behind. Then my horse, an exceedingly
vicious brute, nearly succeeded in appropriating a
piece of Angelo&rsquo;s shoulder, as the latter stooped to
tighten the girths. I found afterwards that my steed
had a very bad character all over the country; his ill
fame, however, was slightly redeemed by the fact that
he was a good goer. Then we missed our way among
the mountains, and with difficulty succeeded, just as
it was getting dark, in reaching a small house at
Guebla, kept by a Frenchman. The proprietor received
us very hospitably, and gave us all the accommodation
he could: it was of rather a limited character,
inasmuch as we all slept together in the small room
where we dined and breakfasted. Our host informed
us that there were a great number of lions in the
neighbourhood. He had himself been surprised by
one, just after dusk, on the road from Milianca, and
offered to induce the Caid of the adjoining tribe to
get up a battue on our return. He also spoke of the
great number of wild boars in a way that would make
a hunter&rsquo;s heart leap within him. We retired to rest,
and, sheltered for the nonce from the searching cold,
I slept as only a weary traveller can.</p>

<h3>FURTHER EXPERIENCES.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Abd-el-Kader (but not the Emir).&ndash;&ndash;Difficult Road.&ndash;&ndash;Perils of the Way.&ndash;&ndash;Prospect
of Sport.&ndash;&ndash;The First Boar.&ndash;&ndash;The Chasseurs d&rsquo;Afrique.&ndash;&ndash;Mine
Hostess of the &ldquo;Scorpion.&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Teniet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the hope of obtaining some reliable information as
to hunting prospects, I had in the Caid&rsquo;s lieutenant a
fine-looking fellow, rejoicing in the famous name of
Abd-el-Kader, though he was no relation to the
renowned chief. He gave a long description of the
capture of a boar, that had been wounded by some
Arabs; how he caught the brute by the hoofs, gagged
it, and brought it home alive. Mr. &ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, he also informed
us, had been surprised, about a month before,
by a lion, as he was returning at dusk from Milianah.
There were many lions in the vicinity, he added; and
promised that his friend the Caid should treat us to a
lion-hunt on our return, if we came back this way.</p>
<p>Then we started, Abd-el-Kader accompanying us to
show us a short way over the mountains to the caravanserai
of Oued-el-Massin, where we were to pass the
night, and expected to find our luggage. We were
prepared to find the river very high, and our anticipations
were not deceived. Abd-el-Kader admonished
me to wait on the bank while he went in to try if there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
was any getting through. He returned and asked if
my horse was good, and if I was willing to follow him.
On receiving my affirmative answer, he told me to fix
my eyes on the opposite shore, and, above all things,
to abstain from looking at the water, which was tearing
along at a tremendous rate; if I neglected his instructions,
I should infallibly be carried away and drowned.
I started, and, by dint of spurring, managed to get
across, though my horse plunged up to his shoulder,
and at one moment I thought I was a &ldquo;gone coon.&rdquo;
Abd-el-Kader, the undaunted, then went back once
more for the second horse, which he dragged across in
due time by the bridle. Then he pointed out to us
the road over the mountain to Oued-el-Massin; nor
did he think it derogatory to his dignity to accept a
reward for the trouble he had taken on our behalf.</p>
<p>In spite of the valiant lieutenant&rsquo;s directions, the
road was a very difficult one to find. After wandering
about in the forest through a number of out-of-the-way
paths, we managed at last to stumble on an Arab house
or two, where the promise of a supply of powder prevailed
with an Arab, and he piloted us down to the
caravanserai, where we arrived at about six <span class='smcaplc'>P.M.</span>, wet
to the skin, and weary with a most fatiguing day&rsquo;s
march. We found our luggage had preceded us by
about half an hour; so we had a change of clothes, and
sat down gleefully to a capital dinner in very comfortable
quarters. These caravanserais are a famous institution.
They are built by the French Government for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
the convenience of travellers, and are very well
organised. Each one is under the superintendence of
a Frenchman, and has one part devoted to Europeans
and another to Arabs. We had an excellent sitting-room
and bed-room to ourselves, and, as may be supposed,
were exceedingly comfortable.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the 14th of March, was ushered in by
a pouring rain; and we received the agreeable intelligence
that the river between this and our next station
was perfectly impassable; so we made up our minds to
stay where we were. There was some consolation in
the thought that Joseph, the exceedingly keen horse-dealer
at Medea, will not be entitled to charge extra
for the delay to his mules, he having bound himself,
by solemn covenant, to deliver the baggage safely at
Teniet for a certain stipulated sum.</p>
<p>After breakfast I walked into the forest which surrounds
the caravanserai on all sides, and shot two or
three brace of red-legged partridges and a woodcock.
I saw the traces of several wild boars; they were evidently
quite recent; also a wretched porcupine the
Arabs had killed.</p>
<p>In the course of the day the Arabs brought in
a boar which they had killed in the morning. They
threw the entrails outside the house, and, during the
night, quite an army of jackals came down to devour
them. It was so dark that we could not get a shot at
these African scavengers, though I sallied out once
or twice after them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>It rained all night, so that going on was out of the
question, from the swollen state of the river; so I
walked off before breakfast, with Angelo, to an Arab
village, about a mile and a half distant, to inquire
about boars. The promise of some powder brought
out the inhabitants; and, after a little banter and
chaffing, they agreed to meet me after breakfast, and
to show me one of those animals. So I returned to
the caravanserai to breakfast, and then, with my
friend, rode back to the Arab huts. We left our
horses at the village, and proceeded to climb a horribly
steep hill in company with some of the natives, to
whom I had promised tobacco-money, on condition of
being brought face to face with a boar. After some
tremendously steep climbing, we came upon a number
of recent tracks, one of which B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; followed with his
Arab, while I remained in another gorge. Presently
I heard a shot fired, about a mile off; and, on returning
to where the horses were tethered, I found that
B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; and his Arab had succeeded in discovering a
boar. The Arab had fired at the brute at <a name='TC_3'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'twent'">twenty</ins>
paces, but missed his aim. It was now past five
o&rsquo;clock, so we returned to the caravanserai to dinner.
Some Chasseurs d&rsquo;Afrique had arrived in the interim.
Their captain joined us in our room, and promised us
an escort for the morrow. He was from Boulogne-sur-Mer,
and spoke English pretty well. He told us
we should have to start at six in the morning to cross
the river.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>Accordingly, next morning the Frenchman set
out at six o&rsquo;clock with his troops and traps, leaving a
dragoon behind as an escort for us, but with the
important qualification that the man might only stay
one hour behind the rest, as he must be present on
the arrival of the troop at Teniet. &ldquo;<i>Et maintenant</i>,&rdquo;
quoth this bold warrior, &ldquo;<i>je vais me servir d&rsquo;un peu de
votre tabac, s&rsquo;il vous plait, car je vois que votre blague
est bien garni;</i>&rdquo; and, filling his pipe, he vanished,
with a polite &ldquo;<i>Au revoir, messieurs</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling too tired to rise at seven for the sake of
escort, especially as we had not a very long journey
before us, I remained comfortably for breakfast, and
B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; started alone. After a good meal, I set out
with Angelo, and we forced our way through a densely-wooded
country, till we came upon the obstacle which
had lost us two days&ndash;&ndash;the river Klebah. This stream
we managed with some difficulty to cross; a Frenchman,
who emerged from the auberge on the other
side, assisting us, by his advice, as to the best spot to
choose for our passage. B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; and the trooper had
just finished breakfast in the auberge, and departed.
The landlady of the &ldquo;Scorpion,&rdquo; a very chatty and
amusing personage, insisted upon it that I was a German.
She favoured me with a sporting anecdote,
setting forth how she had killed three rabbits during
an expedition to pick some rose laurier on the hills.
As the bunnies popped their noses out of their holes,
she had managed to pop them off with the branches.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
As this was the only house to be met with on that
day&rsquo;s journey, I halted there for half an hour. Mine
hostess related how an &ldquo;English milord&rdquo; had stayed
there for six months with his wife, in a tent, without
even a servant&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;ils sont dr&ocirc;les ces Anglais!</i>&rdquo;
was the landlady&rsquo;s final comment; and it was not for
me to contradict the oft-repeated sentiment.</p>
<p>Through a mountainous and most barren country,
amid a pelting snow-storm, we wended onwards to
Teniet. In my way from El Massin to the &ldquo;Scorpion,&rdquo;
I might almost have knocked over several partridges
with my whip, so close did they come; but here there
were none to be seen, nor was there any cover that
might shelter them. At a miserable auberge called
&ldquo;<i>les C&egrave;dres</i>,&rdquo; I found B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;.</p>
<p>The fort at Teniet is a fine edifice, in a commanding
position. I went up and left my letter of introduction
for Captain Camatte, who gave us very small
hope of sport. He did not seem very keen on the
subject, and advised us to try some other place, offering
to give us recommendations, &amp;c. I returned to a
most miserable room, where we could hardly sit, so
much were we annoyed by the smoke from the fire;
we could scarcely decide which was hardest to bear,
the smoke within, or the cold without. With a hearty
laugh at the absurdity of coming to such a place as
Teniet in search of game, and with a determination
to set out on our return the next day, we betook
ourselves to an early bed.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In order to avoid the trouble of carrying our ammunition
back with us, we sold the greater portion of it.
The snow lay four or five inches deep in the road; we
sent to the commandant to procure us mules and
other necessaries, and set out, with a snow-storm
beating down upon us, and the cold as sharp as it well
could be. At the &ldquo;Scorpion&rdquo; we refreshed ourselves
with coffee, and then re-crossed the river, which was
scarcely fordable; we got to El Massin about six
o&rsquo;clock; the brigadier told us he had shot a hyena.
Some capital wild boar they gave us for dinner, seemed
to be an earnest of our return to sporting latitudes.
At half-past seven next morning, we emerged from the
caravanserai. The weather seemed at last, after a
long season of inclemency, to have set in for heat.
&ldquo;<i>Le temps s&rsquo;est remis a neuf</i>,&rdquo; observed Mr. Ball; and
it had changed with a vengeance, so far as the temperature
was concerned. Terribly hot we found it,
marching across the Milianah plain. We crossed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
Djelish in a bac, or flying bridge, and reached
Afreville about ten o&rsquo;clock. Leaving B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; and
Angelo to proceed to Medea, I went on to Milianah,
where I arrived at about twelve o&rsquo;clock. While
waiting there for my baggage, I noticed some Arab
boys playing at a game closely resembling hockey.
Milianah is a very strong fort, with a splendid view
over the Atlas mountains and the plain of the Djelish.
I stopped at the Cat or Du-chat stables, appropriately
kept by Mr. Duchat-<i>el</i>, and found that it was too late
to stop at any place on the road to Blidah.</p>
<p>I took a walk through the town, and on the Grande
Place found a number of soldiers singing a chorus
very creditably, without instrumental accompaniment.
They perform in this manner every Sunday. The
view over the plain of the Djelish is one of the most
splendid I ever beheld, not excepting that from the
Alhambra itself. I was told I could easily get to
Blidah in a day on horseback, from Milianah, so I
determined to stay at the H&ocirc;tel d&rsquo;Iffly, a very comfortable
place. At dinner I met Mostyn and Captain
Ross, just arrived from Algiers, per diligence.
Captain R&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, who is in the Bengal Artillery, told me
he thought the French used the natives much better
than we do those of India. I differ from him. One
of the French officers with whom I dined told me the
only way to manage the &ldquo;Indig&egrave;nes&rdquo; was by that
vigorous measure, &ldquo;<i>un coup de fouet</i>,&rdquo; and, from what
I saw, I believe it to be the case.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>On Monday, the 19th, I left Milianah at about half-past
seven, and rode through splendid Pyreneean
scenery to Vezoul, a French village. The aubergiste
took me for a German, and announced that he had
two German workmen staying with him, who spoke
with the same accent I used. When I repudiated
my Teutonic nationality, he met me with the remark:
&ldquo;<i>Enfin, c&rsquo;est le m&ecirc;me sang rouge qui coule dans
nos veines, que nous soyons Anglais, Fran&ccedil;ais, ou
Allemands;</i>&rdquo; to which undeniable proposition I rejoined,
&ldquo;<i>Oui, c&rsquo;est vrai nous sommes tous Europ&eacute;ens
ici.</i>&rdquo; I fed my horse here, and came on, over the
mountains, under a very hot sun, to Bourkikah, where
I entered the Medidja plain. On entering this plain,
the traveller enjoys a magnificent view right onward to
sea, gleaming miles away in the sunny haze. At
Bourkikah, my horse was so tired, that I was obliged
to take off the saddle-bags, and leave them at the
&ldquo;Bureau des Diligences,&rdquo; to be forwarded. Some
French officers at the hotel assured me I should not be
able to get to Blidah, and recommended me strongly
to stay at El Afroun, &ldquo;<i>chez les Petits Fr&egrave;res</i>,&rdquo; if I
found my horse too tired to proceed. I rode determinedly
on through the plain, but could scarcely
get my horse to move by dint of whip or spur. By
the time I had crossed the river into El Afroun, I found
my horse so entirely knocked up, that it was clearly
impossible to proceed. So, of necessity, I turned into
the auberge, and had a very good dinner, enlivened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
by a serenade from a legion of frogs, croaking dolefully
in the neighbouring marshes.</p>
<p>Getting away from El Afroun by six o&rsquo;clock next
morning, I found myself at Blidah by half-past seven.
The cavalry horses were just turning out on the plains,
and looked very handsome as I rode into the town.
At Blidah, where I breakfasted, the sun was hot
enough to burn my face in a most unequivocal manner,
and to necessitate the purchase of a new hat. On
arriving at Bouffanieh, I got off my horse, which by
this time had fairly fallen lame, and took the diligence
into Algiers. At Bouffanieh I was much amused at
the proceedings of a group of Arabs, who were squatting
on the ground, selling oranges. Their first customer
was a drunken Frenchman, who came staggering
up, and began chaffing the vendors; but they evidently
got the better of him in no time, and he retired
in confusion. Next came a grave, steady-looking
Spaniard, who, after much bargaining, marched off
with <i>one</i> orange. He was followed by a little girl,
who very quickly got hold of three. I thought Algiers
improved on a second view.</p>
<p>Next day I went for a ride to the Maison Carr&eacute;e,
with De Warne and Captain Thouars, of the <i>Euphrates</i>.
We had a most magnificent view over the plain of the
Metidja. This was the first night of the Rhamazan.
I visited the mosques, which have been thrown open
to Europeans since the French occupation. Thence I
proceeded to view a strange religious or fanatic ceremony
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
of the Mussulmans; some Swedish naval officers
were with us. The whole affair reminded me of a
meeting of Jumpers, or Ranters. There are no
priests to take part in it. The men stand round in
a circle, reciting prayers to Allah, and calling on
Mahomet, while they work their bodies violently
backwards and forwards, till they lash themselves into
a state of perfect frenzy. One fanatic more zealous
than the rest then rushes forward, cuts himself with a
knife, and stands on the sharp edge of the weapon,
which is held by another. The chaunt or psalm is
then renewed, and another devotee comes forward
howling; snatches a portion of prickly pear, and actually
devours it ravenously. Then another exceedingly
zealous performer&ndash;&ndash;whose face, by the way,
reminded me strangely of the portraits of Disraeli in
<i>Punch</i>&ndash;&ndash;seized some red-hot coals, and held them in
his mouth for a time, afterwards proceeding to swallow
lighted pipes, and execute other salamandrine feats.
After witnessing this spectacle of degradation for some
time, we retired, somewhat disgusted at the buffooneries
perpetrated in this country, as elsewhere, in the name
of religion.</p>

<p>Passage to Bona.&ndash;&ndash;State of Affairs on Board.&ndash;&ndash;Bona.&ndash;&ndash;The Lake
Metitza.&ndash;&ndash;Ain Mokra.&ndash;&ndash;Wild Duck Shooting on the Lake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We bade adieu to B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, who had given us letters of
recommendation to the Admiral, for a first-class cabin
to Bona&ndash;&ndash;a thing difficult to achieve on board the
steamers here, as civilians are only allowed second-class
accommodation, the state cabin being reserved
for the use of naval and military officers, as the
steamers on this line rank as men of war. The boat
was much crowded with soldiers, sailors, and Arabs,
and we had to share a most miserable berth with
eight other occupants. We had arrived too late to
procure cabin places, and were obliged to dine in an
unsavoury den, reeking with pestilential odours. Most
of the Frenchmen grumbled loudly at the miserable
accommodation afforded in return for their money.
Steaming along past a fine coast, we reached Dellis about
eight o&rsquo;clock. I got Angelo to bring me my sheepskin
and cloak, and preferred sleeping on deck to passing the
night in a locality which, for the horrors it contained,
might have figured as a scene in Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inferno.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>The gentle music of the sailors, swabbing the
deck, awoke me next morning. I found we were off
Bougie, a most beautifully-situated place, entirely
surrounded by snow-covered mountains. Here are
distinctly to be seen the ruins of the old wall supposed
to have been built by the Vandals. A rather tedious
day on board, but the occupation of watching the
coast, which is very fine, varied the monotony of the
voyage. We passed Djigelli at about twelve, and
Philippeville at nine in the evening, when I retired
to rest, and, the Fates be thanked, it was in a fresh
cabin.</p>
<p>There was a Jewess on board, a rather pretty personage,
who slept in the same cabin with six men,
most of them French officers, with a coolness that
astonished me. Her husband was in the berth opposite
her; she did not appear to feel the discomforts of her
position, but chatted away gaily in Arabic and French
throughout the whole passage. I don&rsquo;t think she
quitted her berth once.</p>
<p>At half-past six on Saturday, the 25th of March,
came Angelo to announce to me that we were off
Bona. This is a very strongly fortified place. We
were rowed ashore by Maltese boatmen, and, amid a
great crowd and bustle on the quay, landed, and went
to the H&ocirc;tel de France. The proprietors were very
civil, and assigned us a room at the top of the house,
looking out on the place. We sallied forth in quest
of horses to take us to the market-place. An Arab,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
who spoke some very broken and dilapidated Italian,
took us round the market and through the streets,
shouting &ldquo;Reel Ain Mokra!&rdquo; Several Arabs came up
and offered us their horses, but the steeds had such
a forlorn look, that we declined the accommodation,
and settled to start by carriage next morning.</p>
<p>Accordingly, on Monday, the 26th of March, we
set out at five o&rsquo;clock, on a most wretched morning.
The vehicle was the most miserable locomotive contrivance
I ever saw. Drawn by two horses, it pounded
and churned along a most detestable road. We were
obliged to get out several times, and in one place we
stuck in the mud for twenty minutes. It was only
by dint of putting our united shoulders to the wheel,
that we succeeded in extricating our unhappy chariot
from its stationary position. At length our eyes were
gladdened by the sight of the defile which opens on
the lake Metitza, where Count Z&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;s property is
situated. Though of Polish origin, the Count is an
Englishman, and has, I believe, been an officer.
Right gladly we alighted from the carriage, and, loading
our guns, prevailed on some Italian fishermen to
take us out in a boat for a pop at the wild ducks which
we saw flying about by hundreds, bagged a few, and
then returned to find that the Count&rsquo;s keeper had
come down, under the impression that we were
poachers, with a firm determination to take us into
custody there and then. The production of our letter
of recommendation brought him back to civility, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
produced an offer to take us out shooting; Count
Z&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; himself was absent in London.</p>
<p>There is an establishment here for the manufacture
of oil from putrid fish, which agreeable occupation
announced itself in the shape of such an overpowering
odour, that I seized a glass of cognac, and fled precipitately,
taking my way towards the caravanserai of
Ain Mokra. Poor old Nero, whom I had brought
with me, got into a scrape here, and narrowly escaped
being drowned. It appears that the putrid entrails of
the fish are thrown into a kind of pond, which is thus
filled with a slimy mixture resembling clay, and
exhaling a most horrible odour when exposed to the
sun&rsquo;s rays. Nero contrived, in some way or other, to
slip into this delectable compound, and there he would
have remained, had I not laid hold of him and pulled
him out by main force. I at once had him washed
and scrubbed, and even emptied some scent on him,
but in vain; for days afterwards, poor Nero carried
about with him a reminiscence of his odoriferous adventure,
which rendered his absence most desirable to
the comfort and well-being of his friends. I sallied
forth about four miles from Ain Mokra, and lay in
ambush for boars, but none appeared, and only shot
some jackals&ndash;&ndash;a very poor substitute for the nobler
game I had missed.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At five, next morning, I went out to shoot on the
lake. I got Angelo to row a boat slowly among the
reeds, and soon saw hundreds of wild ducks, teals,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
and large white birds of whose name I am ignorant;
they looked to me like flamingoes. I could only
succeed in bagging a few, as they were exceedingly
shy, and made off as soon as the boat approached;
moreover, the rushes were not thick enough to afford
us an effectual concealment. As the miasma from the
lake was sufficiently powerful to threaten fever, we
returned to the caravanserai, where we breakfasted,
and, after shooting a few quails, returned in our
carriage, at one o&rsquo;clock, to Bona. My driver, who sat
beside me, was a very loquacious old soldier, who had
served in the campaigns against the Arabs under
Baraguay d&rsquo;Hilliers and Youssouf, and been present
at the capture of Milianah and Medeah. The Arabs,
he said, never met the French fairly <i>en bataille rang&eacute;e</i>,
but always fired from ambush at the rear-guard, and in
this way killed a great number of men. He described
the conduct of the Arabs to their prisoners as very
merciless. They never gave quarter, and frequently
mutilated their captives; the women, in this particular,
being more cruel than the men. I was informed,
on my return, that the party who came out last year
to shoot, had only killed four lions in as many months,
though they had &ldquo;all appliances and means to boot,&rdquo;
and always kept several Arabs in their pay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Algeria in general.&ndash;&ndash;The Arabs and their Conquerors.&ndash;&ndash;Antagonism
between the Two Races.&ndash;&ndash;Social Condition of the Arabs.&ndash;&ndash;The
Oasis steamer.&ndash;&ndash;Arrival at Tunis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 28th of March I left Bona in the steamer
<i>Oasis</i>. The engine broke down shortly after leaving
the port, and, as the sails were absolutely useless, we
had the pleasant consciousness of drifting towards a
lee shore; but in a short time the damage was luckily
repaired, and we proceeded on our voyage.</p>
<p>The accounts I had heard of Algeria had not prepared
me to find such a flourishing state of affairs as I
really found to exist in the community. The colony
possesses fine harbours, a magnificent soil, and a
glorious climate; numerous towns, with good hotels,
are springing up in the interior. It is true that many
of the immigrants are not French, but the majority
are of that nation; and all the inhabitants, after a few
years, adopt the French manners and language. The
non-Gallic population are chiefly Spaniards, Italians,
Maltese, and Germans. I met only one party of
English at Bona, where a community of eighteen souls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
have been brought over by a Mr. Vincent; they
appear to thrive very well. I was told that Count Z&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;
intended establishing an English village near Bona.</p>
<p>From the general prosperity, I, of course, except
the Moors and Arabs, who will never, I believe, adopt
European civilisation; they seem to recoil from before
it, like the wild beasts of their native deserts.</p>
<p>The French people certainly pointed out to me in
the towns one or two <i>Europeanised</i> Arabs, and laughed
at the idea of their ever becoming &ldquo;<i>Fran&ccedil;ais</i>.&rdquo; From
what I saw, the natives merely adopted the vices without
the good qualities of the dominant race. If to be
civilised consists in sitting in the <i>caf&eacute;s</i>, drinking
absinthe, playing cards, and speaking bad French, I
certainly saw one or two most unquestionable specimens
of the Arab adaptability to Gallic impressions;
but, with the exception of these brilliant results, I
never saw the least token of intercourse between the
Moors and their conquerors; indeed, each nation may
be said entirely to ignore the existence of the other.
The peculiarity of Mussulman habits, with regard to
women, entirely precludes all prospect of a future
mixture of the two races&ndash;&ndash;such an amalgamation, for
instance, as occurred in our own country between the
Norman-French conquerors and the conquered Saxons.
So well are the French aware of this impossibility, that
I have seen the question of the expediency of utterly
expelling the Mussulmans from Algeria gravely discussed
in the French journals.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>Another method proposed was, that the young
Arabs who had attained the military age of from
eighteen to twenty-two years, should be transferred to
France, there to pass their period of service as infantry
soldiers only, that opportunities might be found, during
their &ldquo;soldiering years,&rdquo; for instructing them in agriculture,
and the rudiments of civilised education.
This appears to me a sufficiently feasible plan; but I
suspect that the Arab converts to civilisation would,
on their return to their native land, quickly relapse
into their old idle, roving habits, their primitive mode of
life, and their inborn hatred of the infidel, whom they
now regard as an instrument sent by Providence to
inflict vengeance on the true believer for his apathy,
and culpable neglect of his religious duties, including
the propagation of his faith by fire and sword. Still,
they believe the time to be approaching when every
true son of the prophet shall &ldquo;hae his ain&rdquo; again;
and it is past the power of mortal man to shake a
Mahometan&rsquo;s trust and reliance on Destiny.</p>
<p>For the rest, the French behave with the greatest
toleration towards all members of the Moorish faith,
who are allowed to perform every rite of their religion,
and polygamy even is permitted to prevail among the
Mussulman population. At Bona, a very handsome
mosque is being erected on the Grand Place by the
Government. Tolerant themselves, the French refuse,
with perfect justice, to suffer any display of bigotry or
fanaticism on the part of the Mahometans towards the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
Christian community; the consequence is, that the
mosques and other resorts of Mahometans are all
thrown open to European visitors.</p>
<p>My dog Nero was a most decided favourite on
board the French steamer, <i>Oasis</i>. Everybody was
caressing and patting him, from the captain to the
stewardess, rather a nice young female, from Germany,
who took him under her especial protection, and looked
after his creature-comforts in a way that must have
aroused the most lively gratitude in the canine bosom
of the said Nero. Poor old dog! he seemed quite
bewildered at the attention he received, not only here,
but also on board the French man-of-war, the <i>Tartar</i>,
where the French soldiers and sailors were crowding
around him all day long, and overwhelming him with
favours, in the shape of bits of meat, when they took
their meals. A number of Arabs were sleeping about
the deck. These children of the desert used to excite
Nero&rsquo;s especial wonder. Whenever he was let loose,
he was sure to be sniffing about among the prostrate
figures, examining their faces and <i>bournouses</i>, and
often waking them up with a start, to the intense
delight of the French tars.</p>
<p>On our arrival off La Goulette, the only anchorage
for ships, situated about eight miles from Tunis, by
sea, and nine miles by land, we were greeted by a
scene of the most tremendous confusion. All the
feluccas were rowed by Arabs, and their shouting,
swearing, and gesticulation exceeded all my former
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
experiences of the kind, Stamboul not excepted. A
little patience, and a good deal of backsheesh, enabled
us to pass our baggage through the Douane; and we
sent it on by boat to Tunis, whither we proceeded by
land in a carriage, and a drizzling rain. Once on the
way we stopped, at what the inhabitants term the
&ldquo;Carthaginian cistern,&rdquo; to take in some exceedingly
dirty water, from a fountain of old-fashioned appearance.
The carriage windows were closed on account
of the rain&ndash;&ndash;an arrangement which interfered a good
deal with my view of the surrounding country.
Twice only, before we arrived at Tunis, my companion,
a Russian, opened the window&ndash;&ndash;to spit! On
the first of these occasions, I got a glimpse of a large
heap of immense stones, which were pointed out to
me as the ruins of Carthage, and a grove of olives,
looking dismal exceedingly in the drizzling rain. On
the second occasion, I saw the lakes, and a solitary
Tunisian sentinel. This soldier was dressed much in
the Turkish costume, and I should scarcely have
known him from an Osmanli, but that he wore the
brass plaque in the front of his scarlet fez, instead of
at the top.</p>
<p>As we approached Tunis, we became involved in
an increasing crowd of loaded asses and mules; and,
amid a great deal of screeching and shouting, we made
our entry into the city, and drove to the H&ocirc;tel de
France, where we obtained such a complete view of an
old wall, that it effectually prevented us from seeing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
anything else. The rooms, or rather holes, assigned to
us, were so miserable, that we tried the solitary
opposition shop the place can boast&ndash;&ndash;the H&ocirc;tel de
Proven&ccedil;e&ndash;&ndash;but found that here we should fare rather
worse than in the H&ocirc;tel de France. There was a
third establishment&ndash;&ndash;a tavern, rejoicing in the magniloquent
title of &ldquo;Hotel of the Britannic Isles&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;but
as this hostelry was entirely occupied by sailors and
Maltese skippers, we declined to avail ourselves of the
&ldquo;Britannic&rdquo; accommodation. There was a great crowd
of rather miscellaneous company at the <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.
One French female, whom, without offence to gallantry,
I may be permitted to describe as the ugliest woman
I met in my travels, excited my especial horror. This
charming person actually amused herself, and disgusted
her neighbours, by indulging, <i>across the table</i>,
in an amusement generally associated in men&rsquo;s minds
with the chewing of tobacco! I discovered, however,
that she was only a servant maid.</p>

<h3>MARSA.</h3>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Angelo&rsquo;s Horsemanship.&ndash;&ndash;The Bey&rsquo;s Palace at Marsa.&ndash;&ndash;The Arabs and
their Love of Tobacco.&ndash;&ndash;The Friendly Moor at Camatte.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the first of April I rode to Marsa, a little town on
the seashore. Angelo&rsquo;s horse seemed rather fresh,
and my servant was evidently no Centaur. He came
up to me in an olive wood, where I made a halt for
about five minutes. He was holding on hard by the
mane, his trousers were up to his knees, and his face
was horribly pale. On my asking him why he loitered
behind so, he owned, with a dismal sigh, that he was
half afraid of the horse. &ldquo;Afraid of the horse, sir!&rdquo;
was poor Angelo&rsquo;s lament: &ldquo;Very wicked horse, sir&ndash;&ndash;fell
from a horse, sir&ndash;&ndash;at Scutari, sir&ndash;&ndash;broke three
ribs, sir&ndash;&ndash;and in hospital five weeks, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him to be of good cheer, for the horse would
soon be quiet after a good gallop; and, tying the
horses to some olive trees, I bade Angelo wait for me
by the side of a little hillock in the plain, where I
could readily find him on my return, and went away
into the forest with my gun. The ground was covered
with long, thick, pointed grass, very wet with the dew.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
I saw some quails, and shot a few; then returned to
where Angelo was waiting, and galloped on to Marsa.
At this place, the Bey, and the principal inhabitants
of Tunis, have summer residences, to which they resort
for the sake of sea-bathing. On the way, I
encountered a number of Arabs, mounted on mules.
The foremost shouted out to me in Arabic, as I passed,
asking me to stop and give him some tobacco. I
understood the word &ldquo;tobacco,&rdquo; which seems to have
nearly the same sound in all languages, and knowing
this request to be often a &ldquo;dodge&rdquo; on the part of the
Arabs, who want an opportunity to rob, if not to
murder, the traveller, I pointed to Angelo, who was
following, about fifty paces behind me, with my gun,
and shouted out that <i>he</i> would find tobacco for them.
They evidently understood my meaning; for they all
set up a loud laugh, and my friend the tobacconist&ndash;&ndash;or
rather the tobacco-less&ndash;&ndash;looked exceedingly &ldquo;sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found Marsa very prettily situated, opposite to
the bay of Tunis, near the ruins of old Carthage. The
Bey&rsquo;s palace is a handsome building. The English
and French consulates are also well built. I proceeded
to a small Italian <i>locanda</i>, to get breakfast; but the
old lady, who seemed the presiding genius of the
place, obstinately refused to let us have anything.
&ldquo;<i>Io han niente</i>,&rdquo; was her unanswerable argument.
But I rather ostentatiously pulled out my watch, whose
golden blink somewhat softened the old lady&rsquo;s mood,
and caused her to remember that she might have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
certain eggs, and some bread, and salad, though a
moment before she had been protesting that she had
not even such a thing as bread in the house. Her son,
a handsome young Italian, returned at this juncture,
and we soon had an excellent <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> of sausages,
salad, spinach, omelette, and cheese, with very good wine
and coffee. I went down to the seaside and bathed,
first burying my watch and purse in the sand; for the
Arabs have a weakness for occasionally coming down
under such circumstances, and stealing one&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>Past a ruined temple, down an avenue into
Camatte, where I got an Arab to show me the way to
a house formerly occupied by an Englishman. Here,
for a wonder, I met a Moor, who spoke very good
French, and was very civil. He asked me how I liked
Africa, and laughed cordially at my open avowal, that
it was &ldquo;<i>un peu bizarre</i>.&rdquo; After gathering a few
delicious oranges for me in the garden, he took me into
the interior of the house. I found it a most charming
residence, with a deliciously cool marble reservoir in
the centre, full of gold and silver fish.</p>
<p>I rode back by the margin of the lake, but saw
only small game till I got to a large olive forest, where
a jackal made his appearance. I gave chase, and,
after a rattling gallop, lodged him among some cactus
bushes, where I could get near enough to shoot him;
and so back to Tunis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sleeman.&ndash;&ndash;The Oued el Ahwena.&ndash;&ndash;Its Scenery and its Dangers.&ndash;&ndash;Beauty

</blockquote>
<p>I started next day with the Umbra, who was
remarkable for a long scimitar, and spurs nearly as
long. Each time I put my horse to a gallop, he was
under the impression that I wanted to ride a race
with him, and went on at full speed, till I restrained
his ardour. We arrived duly at Sleeman, where the
Caid had everything prepared very comfortably for us.
My friends B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; and F&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; arrived later, in a carriage.
We had a good Arab dinner, with the national
kouskous, followed by a chibouk.</p>
<p>There was a river about six miles off, where boars
were rumoured to make their abode. I rose early
next morning, and, proceeding to this stream, hid in
the thicket on the banks, while the Arabs beat the
bushes. After waiting a long time, I managed to
&ldquo;pot&rdquo; a wild boar, which came rushing past me at full
speed. After this, the Arabs refused to beat the
bushes any more, declaring that the dogs were tired,
though the real reason was that they wanted their own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
dinners, so I was obliged to give up the sport and
return. The wild boar was dispatched as a present
to the consul.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The river which we visited to-day is called the
Oued el Ahwena. It runs through a rich valley,
bordered on both sides by mountains which rise up
gradually, and are covered to their very foot with
trees of various descriptions. The plain itself is
fragrant with myrtles, orange trees, and olives. The
beauty of the scene amid which this river falls into
the sea is beyond description. Here the water is
hissing wildly among osiers and furze bushes; there
it skips along like a young goat over the small pebbles;
and yonder, again, it winds like a serpent among the
sand hills on the sea-shore. The dark olive-trees on
the bank seem to look seriously on, like a father
watching the pranks of a favourite child. The large
ash-trees shake and quiver, like old aunts, all in a
tremble at the dangerous hops and vagaries of a lively
niece; while the gay-plumaged birds of the air ring
out their wild applause, and the flowers on the bankside
murmur tenderly, &ldquo;Oh, take us with you, dear
sister!&rdquo; But the joyous, sparkling river rushes on
like a coquette, bounding and skipping towards its
goal.</p>
<p>Such is the river Ahwena in the glorious month
of April: fair without, like many a gay flirt, she can
yet inflict wounds incurable, if not death, upon those
whom her wiles entrap. Woe to the traveller or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
hunter who, oppressed by thirst in this burning
climate, ventures to taste the sparkling water that
bubbles up like champagne, invitingly at his feet!
Cholera and death would be the probable result. The
waters are redolent of cholera, and the banks of fever.
No man may pitch his tent in safety for a single night
on the banks of this death-dealing water; not even
the Bedouins, who avoid the locality as if it were
plague-stricken, for fever is in the very air. Strange
that so fair an exterior should veil so baneful a
mystery. Those bright, sweet-smelling flowers conceal
snakes and reptiles whose bite is almost instantaneously
fatal, and the place might be appropriately termed
the Valley of Death. Among yonder fair trees lurk
the treacherous panther and the slinking hyena.</p>
<p>Yet, in this world, amid present impressions of
pleasure, we have little time to think of the danger
veiled beneath the smiling outward shape. So, at
least, it was with me, as I reclined on the carpet of
soft grass, after slaying the boar, placidly discussing
my breakfast, and enjoying the beauty of the scene
around, with the azure-rippling sea about two miles
off, the magnificent mountains around me, the sparkling
river at my feet, and, across the bay in the far
distance, the ruins of the once mighty city of Carthage,
with the birds singing merrily overhead in the bright
sunshine. There is exquisite pleasure in the sensation
of the external world thus melting away, as it were,
into a little world of our own, and when the green trees,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
the azure sky, the perfumed plants, all take their places
in an exquisite picture of Nature&rsquo;s own painting.
Women, perhaps, most indulge this feeling; hence
they often smile with an amiable incredulity when
they hear the &ldquo;lords of the creation,&rdquo; proud of their
scholastic lore, discussing and settling everything,
priding themselves upon having divided all things so
cleverly into <i>subjective</i> and <i>objective</i>, and boasting that
they have furnished their wise heads with so many
drawers (like a chemist&rsquo;s shop, forsooth), with reason
located in one, good sense in another, understanding
in a third, and so on to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>El Greesh.&ndash;&ndash;Shooting Hyenas.&ndash;&ndash;An Expedition with the Arabs.&ndash;&ndash;The
Caid and his Family.&ndash;&ndash;Another Wild Boar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next day I rode on to a place called El Greesh,
about twenty miles from Sleeman. I wanted to pitch
my tent at the base of the purple mountain, outside
the village, where I was sure we should have got a
great deal of game, as the mountains were covered with
thick underwood. A&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, however, and the rest were
opposed to it, so I yielded, and pitched my tent
in the village itself, where I soon had the entire tribe
around me, examining me and my arms, my gestures,
and everything, as if I was an event. After a cup of
coffee, I determined to start in search of game, and,
with a little backsheesh, got an Arab to accompany us
to one of the neighbouring defiles, where, after waiting
about an hour and a half, I managed to bag a very
fine hyena. He was just sneaking out of his hole,
and was about 150 yards off. On my return, the
natives manifested great joy, shook my hands, made a
circle round me, tapped me on the back, &amp;c., to
my chagrin. As I was tremendously fatigued, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
retired to my sheepskin in my tent with great satisfaction.
The natives all slept around our tents on the
ground, and some of them kicked up a most infernal
noise till about two in the morning, singing a sort of
chorus. The following morning the whole tribe
collected around our tents and watched <i>our toilette du
matin</i> with the most intense eagerness.</p>

</div>
<p>The greater part of them had brought their matchlocks,
as the day was to be a grand field-day, and they
were all in the highest spirits, laughing, and cracking
jokes to an extraordinary amount. We started about
seven <span class='smcaplc'>A.M.</span>, and I remained till eleven <span class='smcaplc'>A.M.</span>, till which
time they had not succeeded in driving anything out
of cover. Here I sprained my ankle in descending a
broken gully, and was obliged to return to the tent.
I came back about four <span class='smcaplc'>P.M.</span>, with only small game.
After sun-down we went out a second time in ambush
after hyena. A lion or panther came, a little after
sunset, and frightened the horses so that they broke
loose, and we returned to the tents about eleven <span class='smcaplc'>P.M.</span></p>
<p>The next day we started early, in order to return
to Sleeman. We stopped an hour on the
banks of our old friend, the river Oued el Ahwenah,
for luncheon, where I shot several quail and snipes,
and a large bird, whose name I ignore, also a hare,
the only one I saw in Tunisia. About four <span class='smcaplc'>P.M.</span>, I
reached the Caid&rsquo;s house; a woman, for a wonder,
opened the door. As the Caid was there, I looked
anywhere but at her. The next day we went out all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
day, after boar, to the river, with an Italian and some
Arabs. I stood up to my knees in the river for about
an hour in the brush-wood, when one rushed by; I
fired, and he rushed forward badly damaged. The
rest fired, and he was found dead a few yards off.
The Italian&rsquo;s steed broke loose, and he left us in
search of it. I broke from my <i>corps de garde</i>. My
horse lost a shoe, and then broke loose, and I had to
follow him for more than a mile. I had a kind of
dumbshow conversation with the Caid&rsquo;s son on my
return, a very fine, handsome lad, about seventeen.
I hear his sister is most beautiful, and I promised to
send him a present, on getting to Tunis, and he is to
write to me and tell me if he receives it. After dinner
the Caid came and smoked two or three pipes, drank
coffee, and wished us adieu in a most gracious
manner.</p>
<p>We had considerable difficulty in bringing home
the boar, as our Arabs all deserted us on account of
its being the Ramadhan; but Angelo and B&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;
managed to carry it back between them. I returned
to Tunis next day.</p>

Race.&ndash;&ndash;The Bazaars.&ndash;&ndash;Mohamed Medea.&ndash;&ndash;The Bardo.&ndash;&ndash;The Bey

</blockquote>
<p>Tunis is situated on the borders of a lake, or rather
inlet of the sea. It is surrounded by a crenelated wall,
which resembles very much that of Constantinople.
Like that city, too, Tunis, from the exterior, presents
a very imposing aspect; but enter the city, and the
illusion vanishes; there is the same dirt, the same
narrow and filthy streets, as in the Turkish capital.
The dogs alone are wanting to make the comparison
perfect. An ancient historian has called this place
<i>Tunis the white</i>; but, like other whited sepulchres, it
is very foul within. The horses, the really thorough-bred
ones, are the finest objects in Tunis. As in the
canine and human, so in every other race, blood will
tell. The Arab horse, though by no means so swift
for a short distance as his English cousin, has a most
marvellous power of endurance. He is also extremely
sure footed, and scarcely ever comes down. I weigh
over thirteen stone, yet have frequently ridden the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
same horse forty English miles per diem, over country
that would infallibly cut up your English two hundred
guinea hunter. They also, so to speak, live on air.
Their chief drawback is that they are, with few exceptions,
stallions, and, consequently, when tethered or
standing near each other, are very apt to fight most
desperately, or else break loose from their tetherings,
when a long and wearisome pursuit is the necessary
result. It is very difficult to come across the best <i>pur
sang</i> horses, as the Arabs are afraid of the Bey&rsquo;s taking
a fancy to them, and taking them by force; and, consequently,
they often purposely mutilate them, lest he
should seize them to himself. There are also some
very fine bazaars at Tunis, and the otto of roses there
is especially excellent. Our Consul has a very fine,
large house, and dispenses his hospitalities, &amp;c., very
generously to his compatriots. His lady is also a
most amiable person. Tunis is, I hear, celebrated for
the manufacture of the red cap, usually termed &ldquo;fez,&rdquo;
which is worn generally throughout Mussulman countries,
and universally by the military. The Tunisian
soldiers wear the plaque in front of the fez, in lieu of
on the top, like the Turkish. As soon as I had
selected my horse, a fine black thorough-bred Arab
(whose price was four hundred francs only), I used to
make excursions every day into the country, sometimes
alone, sometimes attended, always armed, as the
Francs of Tunis told me many stories of the dangers
arising from going out in the country unarmed, among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
the Arabs. I think a great number of them were very
much exaggerated. One of the places I was fond of
riding to was Mohamed Medea, about twelve miles
from Tunis, very prettily situated, where there was a
very fine ruin of a Roman aqueduct, and eke a
French restaurant, where a <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i>, made more
agreeable by a twelve miles&rsquo; ride, was served in quite
Parisian style. The reason of there being a French
restaurant is this:&ndash;&ndash;The present Bey, on his accession,
determined to build a fresh palace at this place;
and, being under a sort of douce compulsion, employs
nothing but French architects and operatives, who
make the hotel their head-quarters, it being about the
only Christian house in the entire place. Quail
abounded in this vicinity, and there were <i>pas mal de
sangliers</i>. To escape from the <i>ennui</i> of the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te
d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> at Tunis, occupied by French bagmen and
milliners, and served in a stuffy hole of a back
kitchen, I used frequently to make Angelo put my
breakfast in my <i>sacoche</i> (saddle-bag), consisting of
a piece of cold meat and some <i>vin du pays</i>, and
then ride out, dismount, and breakfast <i>al fresco</i>, or
rather <i>al bosco</i>; sometimes I am sorry to confess to
breaking the eighth commandment, as I helped myself
to my dessert of oranges, from the trees near or under
which I sat. The Arabs, <i>malgr&eacute;</i> the ogre histories I had
heard of murder and robbery, were always most civil,
and would accept, in spite of the prophet, a glass of
wine from my hands though our conversation was of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
course of the most limited description, unless Angelo
was present to interpret. It is true I always was
armed.</p>
<p>The Bardo is one of the lions of Tunis. It is
the country residence of the Bey, and, besides the
harem, contains a hall of justice and barracks.
It is at Bardo that the Bey holds his court of
justice, in which the cases are decided very quickly,
and with great precision. The interior of the harem,
according to a French traveller, who had visited it, is
fitted up very gracefully. There is a magnificent <i>jet
d&rsquo;eau</i> in the marble court of the interior. The
gallery running round this court on the second storey
is furnished with a very artistically elaborated railing,
or grating, part of which is painted green, part gilt.
Behind this railing the ladies of the harem get a sly
peep at those who visit his highness. The vast saloon
in which the Bey receives his visitors is hung with
crimson velvet, embroidered with gold, and the
ceiling is also gilt and painted over in brilliant
colours. From the two sides of the wall are suspended
different descriptions of arms, richly manufactured;
on the right, they consist of swords and
poniards; on the left, of various kinds of muskets
and pistols. Gold, silver, and precious stones sparkle
out from these arms. Under these weapons are ranged
three rows of divans, covered with a thick sort of red
silk. The centre of the apartment is furnished with
magnificent Persian carpets. On the lowest of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
divans, the principal courtiers seat themselves, on
solemn days of reception, in double file; while at the
extremity, the Bey reclines on an ottoman placed
crossways, and covered with white satin. In Europe,
we might, with great advantage, take a wrinkle or
two from this semi-barbarian prince as regards the
administration of justice with expedition. The
Bey of Tunis is, at one and the same time, the
chief governor of the realm, the administrator of
the public revenues, and the final judge of all grand
cases. From his immediate authority depends the
administration of the police, the imposition of taxes,
the various diplomatic relations, and the superintendence
of the army and navy.</p>
<p>We Europeans can scarcely comprehend how one
man can look after so many different details, or
direct them with order and precision. But in this
country, mark, oh! red-tapeists, everything relating
to interior administration is reduced to the greatest
simplicity, and from this simplicity, freed from the
complicated system of European red-tapeism and
bureaucracy, results, it is to be hoped, a strict economy
in public expenses, and a rapid process in the
courts of justice and other Government affairs. Where
a European prince would require a hundred different
<i>employ&eacute;s</i>, here five or six clerks suffice. Besides the
celerity and economy resulting from such a system, a
third no less important advantage is derived, viz., the
facility with which the Bey is able to superintend the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
conduct of the ministers, being so few in number, and
immediately detect and punish those in whom any act
of embezzlement or fraud has been detected; and
punishment in this country immediately follows detection.
Verily, there are advantages in autocratic as
well as in constitutional dynasties!!</p>
<p>In the administration of justice, too, the Bey is
supreme judge, from whom there is no appeal. The
celerity with which causes are tried and judged, is, I
am told, perfectly astounding. The case merely consists
in a simple exposition of the facts, and such is
the wonderful power of discernment of the merits of
the case which the Bey thinks he has obtained from
long habit, that it is said he rarely deliberates. The
court is open to the public&ndash;&ndash;even to Christians! I
did not go; but Prince Puckler Muskau has left an
account of his presence there. After giving a description
of the room, &amp;c., and the Bey&rsquo;s entry, the
Prince proceeds:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The Bey was now presented with
a magnificent pipe, which was at least ten feet long.
After a few puffs, the audience commenced. The civil
and criminal procedure is so summary, that a great
majority of cases were decided in as many minutes as
they would have taken years in Europe. The subject
of the causes was frequently very trivial, yet the
patience of the sovereign was by no means exhausted.
I thought, in general, that the pleaders were satisfied
with the Bey&rsquo;s decision. One sees, by this, that the
Bey&rsquo;s place is no sinecure; and I am told that few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
monarchs in Christian countries have so much personally
to do. The Bey sits every day in the court,
from eight in summer, and from nine in winter, till
mid-day; and illness, or absence from town, is his only
excuse for non-attendance. His other governmental
duties occupy pretty well the rest of his day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each country has an &ldquo;idea,&rdquo; I suppose, that its
own Government is best, and perhaps it is as well it
should be so. The man who travels much sees the
defects and the advantages of each. Our Parliament
would certainly not easily be acclimatised in Barbary,
nor would a Bey exactly do to grace the British throne.
What, for instance, would we think of such a proclamation
as this in the <i>London Gazette</i>, on a king&rsquo;s accession?
It was issued by Mustapha, the father of the
present Bey, to the consuls of Christian powers:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Glory
to princes of the religion of Messiah. To the

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>THE RUINS OF CARTHAGE.</h3>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Reflections on Ancient Carthage.&ndash;&ndash;Hannibal and his Career.&ndash;&ndash;An
Arab Domicile.&ndash;&ndash;Picturesque appearance of the Ruins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I went three times to the &ldquo;Ruins,&rdquo; and therefore
should have been lucky. I was, however, the reverse,
both as to seeing anything of the ruins, and also the
particular object which brought me there. I think,
myself, proverbs are very deceitful, and should, like
dreams, be read by contrary; some are utterly unintelligible;
as, for instance&ndash;&ndash;will any one tell me
what this one signifies?&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Sweet words butter no
parsnips.&rdquo; I thought parsnips (and, being fond of
vegetables, I should like to know) were generally
seasoned with pepper or vinegar. I am, perhaps, too
stupid to comprehend it, and, like stupid people,
abuse what I don&rsquo;t understand. Therefore, don&rsquo;t let
any one expect a long description of how this part is
Ph&oelig;nician, and is supposed to be where the Carthaginian
parliament was held; or their dandies and
&ldquo;fast&rdquo; of both sexes met to polka of a night, or
drink Punic punch; or a &ldquo;<i>cabinet de lecture</i>,&rdquo; or
club, where the <i>Times</i> or the <i>Globe</i> gave the latest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
telegram from Italy; as how Hannibal obtained a
glorious victory over the Roman troops at Thrasymene,
or that the commissariat was bad; then, perhaps,
old grumblers decried the dissipation at Cann&aelig;,
and the expense of the war; and ancient merchants
on &rsquo;Change complained of the rising importance of
the Roman navy, whose ships had just captured the
large Ph&oelig;nician brigantine <i>Argo</i>, from Sidon, laden
with a valuable freight, otto of roses, and bound for
Carthage&ndash;&ndash;<i>apropos</i> of which I will remark, there is a
military Rome and a mercantile Carthage in modern
times. Take care we be not the Carthage; let us
remember that it was from a stranded Punic vessel
the Romans learnt the maritime art, in which, at last,
they excelled their enemies. Hannibal appears to me
always the greatest man of any age, ancient or
modern&ndash;&ndash;Napoleon not excepted&ndash;&ndash;and perhaps the
most unfortunate. His character comes to us, as his
exploits, from foreign and hostile sources; for I believe
there exist no Ph&oelig;nician records; so that there
remains a great deal of discount to take off in the
way of disparagement, depreciation, &amp;c. &amp;c. It is as
if the future Australian, standing on the ruins of a city
mightier than Carthage, could obtain no account of
Napoleon, but through partial and depreciatory fragments
from the pages of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s life of that
extraordinary meteor. Napoleon, it is true, crossed
the Alps, but Hannibal traversed the Alps and
Pyrenees too, and I fancy the last are the more impassable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
of the two. It is true I have not copied
Albert Smith, or our other heroic youths, but I have
climbed the Malodetta, which well becomes its appellation.
Then, Napoleon had a friendly population
at any rate behind him, to bring supplies, &amp;c.
Hannibal was everywhere surrounded by hostile tribes,
besides having had the disadvantage of a march through
enemies&rsquo; countries of several hundred, if not thousand
miles. I hope the living in Spain, for his sake, did
not then consist of <i>olla podrida</i>, with a variation of
garlic and acid wine.</p>
<p>Perhaps there existed in these days some machine,
or some marvellous powder, by which real mountains
might be removed (as spiritual ones by faith) at
pleasure, and replaced in their original position;
but as history makes no mention thereof, it is but fair
to conclude not. No, the only machine used, the
only mine, was the invincible and iron will of the
Carthaginian hero. He, too, if I mistake not, lived
under parliamentary <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, in the shape of a senate,
a great hamper on military man&oelig;uvres, where all
should be done quickly, secretly, and unanimously.
Napoleon was his own master, with a devoted people.
I wonder if parliamentary debates, in Punic days, were
as long and insipid as in modern; that is, I have not
been to them, but judge by what one reads in that
modern tyrant, the <i>Times</i>. Oh, mighty <i>Times</i>! how
we abuse you, and yet how should we relish our breakfast
without you? who ever comes up to all we look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
for when great occasions call for your wonderful pen,
stirring us to the quick; or whether, in an idle mood,
we seek to while away the passing hour by a description
of the last new folly, or the latest odour of the
Thames, or anything else instructive and amusing.
By the way, if the senate of Carthage took quarter as
long sending supplies to their general as the Commons
discussing the way to purify the Thames, I fancy he
would not have crossed the Pyrenees.</p>
<p>I said I went three times to Carthage; the first
time, an English friend was leaving that day by a
sailing ship, and I had promised to lunch with him at
Goulette, and then see him on board, the first of which
I did in a small house dignified by the name of
<i>locanda</i>, or <i>H&ocirc;tel Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, where some Maltese
captains were breakfasting, who had a strong odour of
onions and garlic, and at another table a Savoyard was
discussing the question of annexation with a Proven&ccedil;al,
in what I may term <i>moiti&eacute; Fran&ccedil;ais moiti&eacute; Italien</i>.
They gave us soup made of, I don&rsquo;t know what, but
the pepper was very strong, or rather, I may say,
would have been, if it were not for the strong taste of
the water, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>; after that, some dried fish,
called sardines, which they said had just been caught.
For second course, we had a sort of <i>gigot de mouton</i>,
which, in form, resembled the temple of Neptune at
the &ldquo;ruins,&rdquo; and you might almost have sworn they
had cut it into that shape on purpose; and quails, very
excellent; and we finished with cheese, which might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
have been manufactured from goat&rsquo;s milk, or cow&rsquo;s
milk, or camel&rsquo;s milk, or all three, or any other milk,
but was dignified by the appellation of <i>Chesterrre</i>, and
was decidedly not Stilton, and eke delicious oranges.
In this dinner we meet, as in life, with much good to
counteract the evil, as the delicious quails made up
for rancid flesh of sheep or horse; so, when next Lady
Julia Plantagenet jilts me, I will remember Jessie
Jones; or, again, as these fragrant oranges, redolent
of the East, caused me to forget the nauseous <i>fromage</i>,
so shall the friendship and good opinion of Brown
console me for the putty eye and freezing regard of
the fashionable Fitznoodle, when next we meet, not at
Philippi, but in the park! After lunch, and adieux, I
mounted my horse for the ruins, as my friend&rsquo;s vessel
did not start as expected that day, owing to the
calm.</p>
<p>On passing the gate of Goulette, several Arab
convicts, in chains, shouted at me for something;
what it was, I ignore; perhaps they asked for backsheesh,
or tobacco, or powder, fine or coarse; or, may be,
they called me a dog of a Giaour, and cursed my
relations and their limbs. This Goulette appears to
be the chief place for the Arab malefactors, and they
are mainly employed in improving the high road
between Goulette and Tunis, and also in repairing the
fortifications.</p>
<p>The afternoon was beautiful, though hot. As it
wanted some time to dinner at Tunis, I made a <i>d&eacute;tour</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
on my return to the ruins, and it requires a fine air
to make you enjoy fine scenery. There was scarcely
a ripple on the blue Mediterranean. Beautiful trees
of every description, olive and orange trees, oleanders,
and others, grew to the very base of the mountain,
and sent up a delicious perfume. I visited the chapel
of St. Louis, from which one enjoys a most delicious
prospect. It is built over some god&rsquo;s temple&ndash;&ndash;whose,
I forget, or even whether a Roman or Punic one; but
this is dedicated to the true God and Christian worship,
in remembrance of that venerable French king, who
is said to have perished here, while on his way to
Palestine, to fight the Moslem. Peace to his ashes!
However, I soon left the hill to re-descend, for I was
very thirsty; all of a sudden, behind an olive bush, I
saw a head, black as ink, pop out; I hallooed to it
first in English, then in Italian. No effect. I saw a
female figure disappear behind a cottage, and out
rushed a fine tall Arab, with menacing gesture, and
more menacing language. I was in his garden. &ldquo;A
glass of water, please,&rdquo; said I, in Italian. Still no
effect. I thought he was going to be savage, when,
from behind the house popped, or rather rolled out,
another little naked, curly-headed, black ball&ndash;&ndash;a
triennial by his looks&ndash;&ndash;the Arab&rsquo;s only boy, no doubt.
He was so irresistibly comic in appearance, that I burst
into a fit of laughter. The man&rsquo;s face changed in a
moment. I suppose he thought I was admiring the
child. He immediately understood what I required,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
which he brought in such a large cup, that I thought
it was intended for a pail. I nearly emptied it, however.
He then volunteered bread and olives, which,
however, I declined, to spoil my dinner. We then
made mutual signs of greeting, and parted. Had
I been able to talk, I would have stopped longer.
There was a sudden friendship sprung up between me
and that poor unlettered infant of the desert.</p>

<h3>THE RUINS AGAIN.</h3>

Catacombs near Camatte.&ndash;&ndash;Quail Shooting.&ndash;&ndash;Trait of Honesty
in the Arabs.&ndash;&ndash;The Arab Character.&ndash;&ndash;Anecdotes concerning them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second time I went to the ruins I went, like Scipio,
to weep, not over Carthage, but the loss of my breakfast;
and the more so that it was to have been a very good one&ndash;&ndash;a
regular pic-nic, or <i>f&ecirc;te champ&ecirc;tre</i>&ndash;&ndash;under olive-trees,
or orange-trees, or palms, shaded from the scorching
rays of Ph&oelig;bus. Champagne, Burgundy (my favourite
wine), were to crown the repast. Nor was the food
to be only corporal, but eke mental, as the great explorer&ndash;&ndash;the
great excavator&ndash;&ndash;was to be there, to have
explained that this was a theatre, that an aqueduct; the
god to whom this temple or that altar was dedicated;
and how many four-in-hands, driven by fast young
Ph&oelig;nician guardsmen, would have been able to pass
each other down that &ldquo;<i>via longa</i>.&rdquo; How many stones
made up that house; and that this was a bath, and not
a harem; and that a certain statue of some celebrity&ndash;&ndash;whose
name I had never heard, and never shall&ndash;&ndash;was,
by some, supposed to lie 100 feet under this marble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
pillar, though, according to others, he might be
102 feet deep interred&ndash;&ndash;for all of which, I daresay,
I should have been the wiser and the better;
but I was sufficiently mundane to regret my <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i>
the most. The fact is, A&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, whose back was
not sufficiently recovered to accompany me riding,
and the American Consul and Davies, had gone
with the edibles and beverages in a carriage, and
were to have met me at the temple of some god.
But, unfortunately, I mistook the deity&rsquo;s name, and
afterwards found that their shrine lay ten miles
off from the one I worshipped at. This will give one
a good idea of the vastness of the ancient city, and
struck me more than all the lectures and description
in the world. Where people were crowded like bees,
as in our London, buying and selling, and riding and
driving, some 2,000 years past&ndash;&ndash;occupied then, as
now, in all the frivolities of this empty world&ndash;&ndash;to find a
complete solitude&ndash;&ndash;a desert nearly&ndash;&ndash;where wander
the jackal and hyena! A very clever people, no
doubt, these same Ph&oelig;nicians were, to judge by their
edifices; yet they had not discovered the theory of
water finding its own level, as the peculiar construction
of an aqueduct proves, the remains of which still
exist, and which was to convey water some forty miles
from the interior. There was a Roman city built over
the Punic one, and the latter alone, of course, interests,
as the former is seen any day, at Pompeii, in better perfection.
Besides Angelo and myself, there was not a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
human being in view&ndash;&ndash;yes, there are three Arab
youths reclining behind that ruin of a wall, motionless
as statues; I thought they were statues at first. Two
have long flint guns, perhaps to keep crows off the
corn, or shoot quails; or, perhaps, to shoot me if they
can; for I have a fine gold chain, not to mention a
ring, which would maintain them till they died of old
age&ndash;&ndash;which could keep them in ease and elegance for
a couple of years, at the least. You have yet to learn,
if you know it not, that ten Arabs, fine men though
they be, with such rusty weapons as yours, are barely
a match for one European with an arm such as mine.
But, my poor boys, there is no chance for you. I
have, you see, a revolver with six barrels. When you
see that, your brow droops as much as your eyes
sparkled when you saw the chain. It is fancy, on my
part, most probably; so, off my horse, and off with
my clothes. The sun was scorching, and I took a
delicious swim in the sea, and then rode on to Marsa,
where is a ruin (everything is in ruins here) of modern
date&ndash;&ndash;the late Bey&rsquo;s palace&ndash;&ndash;a most superb edifice. I
said a ruin, yet it is scarcely a ruin, though fast becoming
so. Marsa is a sort of watering-place for the Christians
of Tunis during the heat of summer. A&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;s description
of the part he visited I will give: &ldquo;I went with Davies
and the Yankee Consul to see the catacombs of Carthage,
near Camatte, which completely undermined a large
mountain by the sea coast. They contain rows of niches
for the coffins, and each chamber communicates with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
others. They hold some twenty coffins each. Some
skeletons have been found, and nails; the former crumbled
to pieces immediately, on being exposed to the air.
These catacombs are now inhabited by hyenas and
jackals, and had a strong odour of those animals.&rdquo; It is
supposed they extend for miles, but the impurity of
the atmosphere precludes entrance to any distance.</p>
<p>My third visit was to shoot quails on ground where,
centuries ago, Hannibal had passed at the head of
his bronzed legions, amid admiring groups of citizens,
the bands playing, perhaps, &ldquo;<i>Partant pour l&rsquo;Italie</i>.&rdquo;
The migration of quails takes place at this season,
and, with a good retrieving spaniel, hundreds may be
shot. But they lie very close, and require a dog to
put them up. They are by no means easy to shoot,
and require snipe shot. They lie in the young corn,
which is very thick and thriving here as on the field
of Waterloo. As I had put up No. 6 shot by mistake,
and had no spaniel, I bagged but few comparatively,
some twenty. A great number of these quails are sent
alive to England, and on board the Italian steamer from
Sicily there were about twenty large cages, containing
about fifty live quails each, which they told me were
going to Britain; they had been caught like larks by
the net.</p>
<p>By the way, I had here a proof of Arab honesty,
refreshing as an oasis in the desert. Riding back
through a village to Goutelle (where I was staying,
previously to embarking for Malta), I dropped my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
powder-flask, unawares to myself. I had not passed
two minutes when I heard a loud halloo, and turning,
perceived an Arab running at full speed to me with
my powder-flask. Now, powder is what Arabs prize
more than gold even, precious stones, or tobacco, yet
they might easily have taken this without my knowing
anything. On my offering him coin worth about sixpence,
the Arab, in broken <i>lingua Franca</i>, made me
comprehend he preferred a few charges of powder,
which I immediately gave, and which he carefully
wrapped up in some old paper. I record this, because
at Tunis and elsewhere, we hear of nothing but Arab
dishonesty and thieving propensities. Is it true, and
this exception a proof of the rule? or are all these
stories false? It is hard to say.</p>
<p>They are a curious race, apparently a mass of
contradictions. One thing is certain; you must not
treat them in the <i>du haut en bas</i> style. They are very
proud, and naturally regard every Christian <i>ipso facto</i>
as individually inferior to the Mussulman, more
specially in the far interior, where Christians have
not as yet penetrated. A&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; and his party had
started for Kef, <i>malgr&eacute;</i> my dissuasions. The fact of a
man going to explore Punic ruins with one going to
discover Mauritanian lions, was, to my mind, like
mixing oil and vinegar, or fire and water, or eating
meat with your knife, or soup with a fork, or taking
two helpings of soup, or anything else incongruous.
D&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; was to be their interpreter. The Arabs there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
told them that a lion can carry away a camel on his
back, but not lift a sheep. This they firmly believe.
The reason assigned is, that in former times (when
animals spoke), the lion said, &ldquo;I will carry off this
sheep, with or without the consent of Allah;&rdquo; and
Allah said to the lion, &ldquo;You shall not;&rdquo; and from
that time the monarch has never been able to lift a
sheep. At one time the man and the lion were great
friends, and the lion did not know he was stronger
than the man. One day, as they were out walking
together, a thorn ran into the lion&rsquo;s foot; he limped,
and stopped to pull it out, when the man, in derision,
said, &ldquo;What! so strong a creature hurt with a thorn?&rdquo;
Then the lion in anger ran the thorn into the man&rsquo;s
eye, who cried out with pain. This proved to the
lion the man&rsquo;s inferiority, and ever after they were
declared enemies. At a place called Tibursok,
where A&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;s party passed on their road to Keff,
not a Christian, or even a Jew, were to be seen,
consequently the Arabs were very intolerant. D&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;
walked into this town alone, in front of the party,
and, speaking Arabic well, questioned one of the
Arabs about some ruin, when another came up and
said, &ldquo;Why do you attend to that dog of a Christian?&rdquo;
D&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; took no notice, when the other shouted out,
&ldquo;Cursed be your father, your mother, and all the
members of your house.&rdquo; D&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; then collared him;
the Arab inquired, &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because you
cursed my relatives,&rdquo; said D&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, seeing the rest of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
the party with the Bey&rsquo;s escort coming up, &ldquo;and now,
just show me the Caid&rsquo;s residence, and I will have you
bastinadoed.&rdquo; However, as some of the other Arabs
crowded round and begged for mercy, D&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; thought
it better to let him off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My fellow-passenger, the Sportsman.&ndash;&ndash;Passage from Tunis to Malta
in a Sailing Vessel.&ndash;&ndash;Disagreeables of the Passage.&ndash;&ndash;Home,
Overland.&ndash;&ndash;Conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the steamer <i>Meludiah</i>, for Malta, I found a
sporting Frenchman on deck. He had been my
fellow-passenger from Bona to Tunis, and carried a
revolver and a gun; the first for porpoises, the second
for gulls, &amp;c. He recounted to me, with great glee,
how he had shot a grosbeak, and some other small
birds, near Tunis, and given them to the cook on
board for our dinner. It was a Mussulman steamer,
and, being Rhamazan, they did not serve dinner till
after sunset. I was nearly famished. The first course
was salad served with rancid oil, which immediately
brought me and the Frenchman on deck. During
the rest of the passage I made Angelo serve my
repasts. The Frenchman was a character. &ldquo;<i>Je
viens de perdre ma femme</i>,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;<i>il y a des
femmes mechantes vous savez, Monsieur, et des femmes
bonnes; la mienne &eacute;tait bonne! mais bonne! Tenez, je
l&rsquo;ai mis dans le cercueil moi m&ecirc;me, et maintenant je suis
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
ici pour me distraire, car je n&rsquo;en trouverai pas une
comme celle-l&agrave;, allez. Je ferai le voyage, j&rsquo;irai en
Alexandrie&ndash;&ndash;n&rsquo;importe o&ugrave;, travailler j&rsquo;irai &agrave; l&rsquo;Isthme de
Suez.</i>&rdquo; At last we arrived in Malta. It is a pity for
officers and others there is no regular communication by
steam between Malta and Tunis; for the <i>d&eacute;sagr&eacute;mens</i>
of a sailing-vessel are by no means despicable. Witness
a friend of mine&rsquo;s report thereon:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;25th.&ndash;&ndash;Came on board the <i>Gemo</i> at seven <span class='smcaplc'>A.M.</span>;
went on shore again at nine, and stopped all day.
Dined and slept on board; rough living here, but no
cattle, which is a great thing.&ndash;&ndash;26th. Set sail at eleven
<span class='smcaplc'>A.M.</span>; fair wind; fine day, and very hot.&ndash;&ndash;27th. Rain
all night; wind light and variable, and one made but
little progress. Cape Bona still close to us this morning.
We are only going at three and three-quarter
knots per hour. A fine breeze got up at twelve, and
at seven we passed Panteleria Isle, going at seven
knots.&ndash;&ndash;28th. Wind fell away early this morning,
and about eleven blew strong from the east: the worst
quarter it could for us.&ndash;&ndash;29th. This accursed wind has
lasted all night, and blows harder this morning; the
sea, too, is very high. It is intensely miserable;
rough sea, bad grub, no one to talk to, no books, and
no idea when we shall reach Malta.&ndash;&ndash;30th. East wind
still; an almighty swell on; one can neither sit, lie,
nor stand with comfort. The coast of Sicily is very
plain this morning. We are about forty-five miles
from Malta, but no one can say when we shall reach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
it. Fresh provisions have nearly come to an end. Let
any one ever catch me on board a sailing-ship again,
unless I am forced.&ndash;&ndash;1st. Half a gale, and a heavy
sea last night; got no sleep, as the ship jumped so;
and the <a name='TC_4'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'mattrass'">mattress</ins>&ndash;&ndash;fancy now!&ndash;&ndash;is stuffed with sticks,
and is so cursedly hard, that, after five days of it, one&rsquo;s
bones ache all over. A very fine day; but this awful
wind still east. At eleven <span class='smcaplc'>A.M.</span> we were off Gozo,
only twenty miles from our destination; but it was
impossible to get there. The diet and food on board
are awful; I am nearly starved. There was only one
thing amusing. A Maltese, who slept in the other
berth near me, sneezed nine times in as many minutes;
and, after each sternutation, he went through a short
formula of prayer, beginning &lsquo;Santo Something,&rsquo; to
keep the devil to leeward, I suppose; and, egad, I
think he must have been on board <i>in propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i>,
under some disguise, to have caused us so bad a passage.
This afternoon, to vary the programme pleasantly, we
had a dead calm. Our miseries seem to have no end.
I begin to think I shall rival the &lsquo;Flying Dutchman,&rsquo;
and never make my port, but sail on for ever.&ndash;&ndash;2nd.
A north-west wind sprang up at five <span class='smcaplc'>P.M.</span>, and we
reached Malta at seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, the sailing-vessel took seven days to do what
I did in thirty hours on the steamer. After the usual
amount of driving, dining, &amp;c., at Malta, in the words
of the poet I bid</p>

<p>And now the word is &ldquo;homeward;&rdquo; and across a
track well known to the English tourist, we journey
onward, till</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>The mountains of Trieste afar are seen,<br />

To Art&rsquo;s supremest works; these all depend<br />
On light, on colour, on the master&rsquo;s hand;<br />

Once more upon the deck I stand and view<br />
Behind that cloud arise old Albion&rsquo;s shore&ndash;&ndash;<br />
Shore that I love, roast beef, plum-pudding too,<br />
Pale ale, the <i>Times</i>, and scandal, like a Briton true.</p>

<h2>NOTES FOR THE SPORTSMAN OR TOURIST<br />IN NORTH AFRICA.</h2>
</div>
<p>The best time to go to Algeria or Tunis is October,
when the heats of summer begin to become cooler.
By all means, let the traveller, if he wish to be independent,
travel on horseback. In Algeria he will meet
with accommodation everywhere, and proceed as safely
as in London, or any part of England.</p>
<p>He can go to Boussada or Laghouat, about six days&rsquo;
journey from Algiers, staying every night at caravanserais
<i>en route</i>. Boussada I did not visit myself, but
from rumour, I believe, there is excellent gazelle
shooting in the neighbourhood. By the plains of
Boussada, the tourist can pass into Tunisia over the
French frontier. At Algiers, the best hotels are the
H&ocirc;tel d&rsquo;Orient and the H&ocirc;tel de la R&eacute;gence, on the
Grande Place. For ammunition, I recommend Hu&egrave;t,
armourer, near the English Consul&rsquo;s; and for horses&ndash;&ndash;Fran&ccedil;ois
or Francisco, a Maltese, who speaks French
and English. The grand thing to be considered is
economy of space. Let every necessary for clothing,
if possible, be crammed into the saddle-bags attached
to one&rsquo;s saddle, as ammunition, guns, &amp;c. &amp;c., must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
be placed on the other horses. Well did the Romans
call baggage by the appellation of <i>impedimenta</i>. In
this country it is so literally, not figuratively. It is
absolutely necessary to have an interpreter who can
talk Arabic; for though in Algeria there are many
natives who jabber broken French or Italian, even this
<i>lingua Franca</i> is so disguised that it is almost impossible
to comprehend them; and in the interior there
are very few &ldquo;indig&egrave;nes&rdquo; who understand anything but
Arabic. In Tunisia nothing but Arabic is of any use
whatever.</p>
<p>To travel in the interior of Tunis, it is necessary to
have a mounted escort, and also a letter of recommendation
to the &ldquo;Caids&rdquo; (mayors) of the different
towns through which you pass. Here you must expect
a great want of comfort, as there are no beds, and you
generally have to sleep on the floor. On the Lake of
Tunis, close to the city, there is very good flamingo
shooting. The flamingoes sit on the water in rows like
a regiment, and the method I employed in shooting
them was as follows:&ndash;&ndash;I used to take a boat with my
gun loaded with buckshot (chevrotine), and my rifle.
I fired my rifle at the line of flamingoes when about
400 yards off, which used to bring them flying over the
boat for curiosity, when I managed, generally with my
gun, to bring down one or two. This is, I am sure,
the best way of shooting them, though several Europeans
told me at Tunis I could shoot them with the
rifle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>The shortest way direct to Tunis is by Malta; and,
in passing, let the sporting tourist visit Gozo, where,
in April and September, there is excellent quail
shooting.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this isle are a simple, primitive
race of people, very lively and intelligent; they speak
nearly a pure Arabic. They live chiefly by fishing,
and also serve as sailors in foreign vessels, where they
remain sometimes entire years without being heard of
by their families. In this way they often find a watery
grave; and in the isle I met some females, whose male
relations had all perished in this way.</p>
<p>Navigation appears to have a great charm for these
simple islanders; and when they sail along these
southern waters, where the sun shines with a brilliant
lustre, and the moon with a fairy splendour, they
forget not the simple home where the members of
their family are crouched side by side, enveloped in a
sort of bournouse, and drinking perhaps tea which
differs only nominally from the tepid waters of the
surrounding ocean, and gabbling a jargon which one
can scarcely believe that they understand themselves.
The charm which binds these poor people together in
their sober and modest existence is less the <i>penchant</i>
of natural and intimate affection, than the chain of
habit, the necessity of a life of fraternal community
and sentiment. A certain equality of position and
social development gives them the same desires, the
same ends of existence, and like ideas produce an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
easy mutual understanding. Each one reads, as it
were, in the eye of the other; and when they talk,
each knows what the other will say almost before he
has opened his lips. All the ordinary relations of life
are thus present to their memory; and so, by a simple
intonation of the voice, by the expression of the
visage, by a mute gesture, they excite, <i>inter se</i>, as
many smiles or tears, more joy or vexation, than we,
among our equals, could perhaps evoke by the longest
demonstrations or declarations. For we civilised ones
live, on an average, in intellectual solitude; each of
us, thanks to our particular form of mind or education,
has received a different bias of character; each of
us, morally weighed, thinks, acts, and believes differently
from his neighbour; and hence misunderstandings
arise so frequently among us, that, even in the
largest families, life in common becomes difficult, and
we are often, as it were, apart, utterly unknown one
to another, and everywhere feel ourselves as on strange
territory.</p>
<p>Races, indeed, have lived&ndash;&ndash;aye, for centuries&ndash;&ndash;in
a state of community of ideas and sentiments
such as I have described in the Isle of Gozo.
Perhaps, but only perhaps, the Roman Church of the
Middle Ages wished to establish among the nations
of Catholic Europe such a state of equality and uniformity
of spirit. Hence, no doubt, the reason why
she took under her guardianship all the social relations,
all the force and manifestations of this life&ndash;&ndash;in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
fine, man himself, moral and physical man. I will
not deny, nor will any one else, that much peaceful
happiness, much piety has been established by these
means; that human existence in the Middle Ages took
an expression of greater fervour and intimacy; that
the arts, like flowers, mysteriously developed, unfolded
then, and showed to the day a beauty we now
admire and deplore, and that the rash and unquiet
spirit of modern days cannot imitate. But mind has
its rights from all eternity; mind will not be fettered
by dogmas, or lulled to sleep by the ringing of a bell;
mind has cast aside his swaddling-clothes, and broken
the string by which his nurse (the Roman Church)
held him, and, in the madness and intoxication of
his holiday, has rounded the globe, has traversed all
nations, has scaled the Himalayas, and, returning
again to Mother Earth, has begun to meditate over
the wonders of creation by day, and the stars of
heaven by night. We know not, indeed, nor ever
shall, perhaps, the number of the stars that shine in
the canopy of heaven; we have not yet unveiled the
dread mysteries of earth or of sea. Enough: many
enigmas are resolved; we know much&ndash;&ndash;we guess at
still more. There remains one question unsolved&ndash;&ndash;it
is this: Is there more real felicity in our minds now
than there was in ancient times? I will confess that
if we look at the many, now-a-days, we could scarcely
answer this question in the affirmative; yet, it must
also be remembered that happiness, which is in part due
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
to mental tyranny, is scarcely true happiness, and that
in the few moments of real intellectual dignity some
educated man can enjoy more real felicity than the
uneducated coal-heaver during many years of uninquiring
tranquillity.</p>
<p>But while, with a certain benevolence, I was dilating
on the intentions of the Roman Church, I find myself
all of a sudden seized with a zeal worthy of Exeter
Hall. So I return to my Gozo friends. Living among
these simple, Christian islanders, of Moorish descent, one
is apt to meditate on the mighty transformations which
have swept over Europe and left them untouched.</p>
<p>The reason I recommend the route <i>vi&acirc;</i> Malta and
Tunis, instead of passing by Algiers, as I did, is the
miserable accommodation on board the steamers between
Tunis and Algiers. The passengers on these boats
are chiefly bagmen and colonists of different nations.
We had a Savoyard, a Spaniard, and two or three
Frenchmen and Italians at one table; and the noise,
and row, and heat after dinner were very edifying.
Bottles were quickly emptied, and heads as quickly
filled. One of the guests sung songs; another
neighed; a third shouted in tragic verse; a fourth
spoke Latin; and a fifth preached temperance; a
sixth gave himself out for a professor, and his lecture
was nearly as follows:&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;The earth, my friends, is a
cylinder, and men are but little diminutive dots
spread over its surface, apparently at hazard; but
<i>voil&agrave;</i>, the cylinder takes a fancy to turn, the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
dots are hustled about, some here, others there, and so
emit a sort of vibratory sound, some frequently, others
more rarely; and this is the marvellous, complicated
music that men call universal history,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c. A
fat-looking German, who kept his nose continually
dipped in a glass of punch, inhaling the steam with a
very gratified look, observed that he felt as though he
was in the refreshment saloon of the Berlin theatre;
while the Savoyard kept looking at us through his glass,
as though it were a <i>lorgnette</i>, and the red wine streamed
down his purple cheeks into his gaping jaws.</p>
<p>And now to proceed to matters of sport. With
regard to small game, partridges, ducks, quails,
rabbits, &amp;c., there is abundance to be found in
Algeria. Near Algiers there is hawking of partridges
and hares among the Arab tribes; and, before the
French occupation, falconry was the especial amusement
of the Arab aristocracy. For shooting of
small game I would more especially recommend
a caravanserai called Oued el Massin, about half
way between Milianah and Teniet. Partridges
and woodcock abound there; the quarters, moreover,
are remarkably good, and the <i>cuisine</i>,
superintended by my friend, Mr. Ball, is by
no means despicable. From Oued el Massin, a
day&rsquo;s journey beyond Milianah, I am convinced
excellent shooting may be obtained with a couple of
good pointers. Quails are also very numerous.
Aquatic birds abound in Algeria, more especially on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
the lake Fetzara, near Bona, in the province of Constantine.
Nothing is more beautiful than the lake
Fetzara at sunrise; on its banks are a thousand plants
and flowers of every colour and hue, and on its waters
repose birds of every description and plumage. As
yet it is dusk; everything animal and vegetable is in
repose; but with the first ray of the sun come
sounds and cries of every imaginable description, and
thousands, aye, myriads, of birds are everywhere on
the wing. In the impetuosity of their flight, they
shake, as it were, the plants and flowers on the border
of the lake, who thus pay their morning salute to the
sun of Africa. A small barque, however, advances
(<i>vide</i> picture), and from this frail skiff suddenly
appears the flash of a gun. In a moment the whole
air is in motion; grebes with their beautiful plumage,
flamingoes with flaming wings, wild swans, and ducks,
and teals, by thousands whirl through the air.</p>
<p>Is it really to be believed that Nature has affixed (so
to speak) some danger to everything charming? One
is almost tempted to say so, after examining the enchanting
borders of this lake, whose azure waters flow
from the mountainous frontier of Tunisia to the opulent
plains of Bona. You botanists, who are attracted by
the singular colour or strange beauty of some plant or
flower here, beware how you approach. Under this
magnificent vegetation a trap&ndash;&ndash;a mortal trap&ndash;&ndash;is laid:
the banks are of quick-sand! One step, and you meet
death&ndash;&ndash;a horrible death. The earth gives way, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
you disappear without a trace, for those delicious
flowers and plants close up their ranks again, like
immortelles over your sepulchre. Listen:&ndash;&ndash;A French
cavalry officer came from Bona to shoot flamingoes
on this lake. He was accompanied by his servant, also
on horseback. He shot a flamingo, who tumbled just
on the border of the lake, and dispatched his servant
to fetch the bird. At three or four yards from the bird,
the soldier disappeared with his horse; and some Arabs,
coming up, at the cries of the officer (for the Mussulman
believes that the genius of the lake, propitious to
Mahometans, devours the profane European), with
difficulty saved his servant. As soon as the soldier
was out of danger, he cried out, with all the gasconade
of a Frenchman, &ldquo;<i>Je ne laisserai pas l&agrave; ce maudit
oiseau, cause de ma m&eacute;saventure!</i>&rdquo; In spite of the
energetic dissuasions of the natives, whom, by the
way, he could not understand, he advanced on foot;
but the earth opened again&ndash;&ndash;he disappeared. One
moment his head remained above this liquid ground,
one moment he cried for aid, and the abyss had
swallowed its prey. However, at certain points, this
lake is quite approachable; and, there being several
barques, excellent sport may be had. I would, however,
recommend sportsmen to procure a letter of
introduction to some neighbouring grandee. There is
an excellent caravanserai close by, at Ain Mokra.
For gazelles one must go quite into the interior of the
desert&ndash;&ndash;to Boussada and Laghouat&ndash;&ndash;in the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Sahara desert. Ghazella is, in the Arab language,
the synonym for beauty and velocity.</p>
<p>Those persons who really desire sport, however, I
would recommend to travel from Algiers to Tunisia by
land, and, if possible, let them pass by Kef, which is
the frontier town. In the vicinity of this town there are,
no doubt, plenty of lions; and my friend (who visited
it with Dr. Davies, the celebrated explorer and excavator
at Carthage) heard of several there, though his
stay was so short that he did not succeed in bagging
one. For lion-hunting, as for many other things, &ldquo;<i>il
faut bien de la patience</i>.&rdquo; Thus it very frequently
happens that a man may search without success for
months and months for the whereabouts of a lion, and
then, suddenly, when your hunter is least prepared for
it, and perhaps unarmed, the monarch of the desert
will present himself to his astonished gaze. Notwithstanding
the formidable character attributed to the
lion, he will rarely attack any man unless previously
molested. There are three sorts of lions in North
Africa&ndash;&ndash;the black, the tawny, and the grey, though
the latter is by some supposed to be the same genus as
the tawny, only grizzled by age. There are two ways
of hunting the lion, by day and by night. That by
day is by battue, when a whole tribe turns out to
&ldquo;beard the lion in his den&rdquo; and make him break
cover. Those who are well armed are posted at the
outlets of the cover or beaten tracks by which the lion
generally passes; any Europeans who assist are usually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
so stationed; they, however, need have but little fear,
for the monarch almost always attacks the <i>tawny</i> native
by preference. Is it from sympathy of colour, <i>similia
similibus gaudent</i>, or from a sort of instinct that the
European is better armed, or because he supposes the
Arab will make a better repast? The other way of
killing the lion is in ambuscade, of which there are
two or three kinds. Sometimes the hunters dig a hole
in the ground near the spot where the lion is in the
habit of passing by night; over this hole they throw
branches of trees, which they cover with stones and
mortar; they then place some bait near, which can
be commanded through holes made in the covering,
and when the lion approaches to examine the carcase,
he is immediately brought down. Another way of
shooting is from a tree. My friend, Count Zamoyski,
who has a residence at the Lake Fetzara, shot several
in this way. I will, however, refer the reader to
Jules G&eacute;rard&rsquo;s book for a description of this kind of
sport. I did not stay long enough in North Africa to
be able to judge of it myself. What I recount now
with regard to lion hunting is from hearsay, not from
personal experience.</p>
<p>The panther is a more dangerous animal than the
lion, and much more cunning. Like his relative, the
cat, he is very difficult to kill, and it must be a well-directed
ball through the head or heart that will
prevent him from avenging his wound. For the rest,
he is hunted much as the lion. I will not mention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the jackal and hyena, both of which animals can be
shot after dusk from the tent or hut, by throwing out
some carcase or bait before sunset to attract them.
Let us pass to that animal which, in my opinion, of all
creatures presents by far the best sport on the coast of
Barbary&ndash;&ndash;I mean, of course, the wild boar, or halouf,
as he is called in the Arabic language.</p>
<p>I had long had a desire to hunt the halouf. On
my arrival at the Caid&rsquo;s house at Solyman (about
twenty miles from Tunis), an old Arab named
Mahmoud was sent for, who was reported to be, like
Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord and before
the tribes.</p>
<p>The next day we started before sunrise to the
river, where the boar was supposed to be.</p>
<p><i>En route</i> I questioned my Arab by interpreter.
&ldquo;The halouf,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;when wounded, is as dangerous
as the lion. I have,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;myself
seen a boar repulse the attack of a young lion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of boars there are no doubt plenty in Tunisia.
They are fond of lying in the thickest brushwood,
what the French call <i>broussailles</i>, and the main difficulty
is to drive them out. It requires some one
perfectly conversant with Arabic, and having some
authority over the natives, to make them beat properly;
otherwise, in a short time they will give over,
and pretend that there is nothing there. The best
localities for boar are near Solyman, in Tunisia, and
Biserta, about fifty miles from Tunis. As for Algeria,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
the country is now so much frequented by Europeans
of all nations, who frighten, if they do not kill, the
game, that one has to go a long way into the interior
before any sport can be met with.</p>
<p>The French talk a great deal about &ldquo;<i>la chasseaux
panth&egrave;res</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>la chasse aux lions</i>,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.; but,
in my humble opinion, their forte is &ldquo;<i>la chasse aux
dames</i>&rdquo; or, in plain Saxon English, the success of the
&ldquo;<i>salon</i>.&rdquo; Let me conclude with a few words regarding
regimen. In this burning climate, above all things
observe temperance. I do not mean by that expression
that you must be a teetotaller, but the more you
can abstain from heating liquids or solids, the better.
The other extreme, too, is bad; too much lemonade,
or water, or sherbet, is apt to produce diarrh&oelig;a.
Nature seems to have indicated to the Arabs the best
beverage in this zone, both to quench thirst and to
preserve health, viz., coffee; but as on a march or
out shooting you cannot always stop to have a fire lit,
the next best drink is a little weak brandy and water,
which you should carry from where you start in the
morning, as the water of the rivers is pestiferous. To
avoid fever or malaria, I would always take a small
quantity of bark of quinine. During the time I was
in Africa I enjoyed most excellent health, as I believe
everybody may who takes the commonest precautions,
and does not indulge, as he may with impunity in
more northern climes.</p>
<p>Finally, let me give one piece of advice to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
sportsman. If he comes to these countries with the
expectation that he can, as in England, go out with
his gun of a morning and return with his bag full in
the evening to a capital dinner, he had better stay at
home. To do anything in this country, a man must
make his mind up to long and fatiguing marches in
the heat of the day, with miserable quarters often at
night, in places infested by vermin of every description;
in a word, he must be content to rough it. I
will also candidly own that, from the accounts I had
previously received, I was very much disappointed as
regards the quantity of large game to be found in
these parts; still, I was, to a certain extent, indemnified
for this by the pleasure of visiting a beautiful
country, a remarkable people, and magnificent scenery,
the entire appearance of which is utterly unlike what
one is accustomed to see in the hackneyed countries
of modern continental Europe.</p>
